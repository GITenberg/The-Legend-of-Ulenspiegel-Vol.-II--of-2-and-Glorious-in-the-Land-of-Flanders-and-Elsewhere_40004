<p class="first">He goes away, the Silent One, God guideth him.</p>
<p>The two counts have been seized already; Alba promises the Silent
One lenity and pardon if he will present himself before him.</p>
<p>At this news, Ulenspiegel said to Lamme: &ldquo;The Duke summons, at
the instance of Dubois, the procurator general, the Prince of Orange,
Ludwig his brother, De Hoogstraeten, Van den Bergh, Culembourg, de
Brederode, and other friends of the Prince&rsquo;s, to appear before
him within thrice fourteen days, promising them good justice and grace.
Listen, Lamme, and hearken: One day a Jew of Amsterdam summoned one of
his enemies to come down into the street; the summoner was on the
pavement and the summoned at a window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come down, then,&rsquo; said the summoner to the
summoned, &lsquo;and I will give thee such a cuff on the head with my
fist that it will tumble into thy breast, and thou shalt look through
thy ribs like a thief through the bars of his prison.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The summoned replied: &lsquo;Even if thou wast to promise me
an hundredfold more, I would not come down even then.&rsquo; And so may
Orange and the others answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did so, refusing to appear. Egmont and de Hoorn did not
follow their example. And weakness in duty evokes the hour of God and
fate.</p>

<p class="first">At this time were beheaded on the Horse Market at
Brussels the sires d&rsquo;Andelot, the sons of Battemberg and other
renowned and valiant lords, that had wished to seize Amsterdam by
surprise.</p>
<p>And while they were going to execution, being eighteen in number,
and singing hymns, the drummers drummed before and behind, all along
the way.</p>
<p>And the Spanish troopers escorting them and carrying blazing torches
burned their bodies with them all over. And when they writhed because
of the pain, the troopers would say: &ldquo;What now, Lutherans, does
that hurt then to be burned so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he that had betrayed them was called Dierick Slosse, who brought
them to Enkhuyse, that was still Catholic, to hand them over to the
duke&rsquo;s catchpolls.</p>
<p>And they died valiantly.</p>
<p>And the king inherited.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Didst thou see him go by?&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel, clad as a woodman, to Lamme similarly accoutred.
&ldquo;Didst thou see the foul duke with his forehead flat above like
an eagle&rsquo;s, and his long beard like a rope end <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>dangling
from a gallows? May God strangle him with it! Didst thou see that
spider with his long hairy legs that Satan vomiting spat out upon our
country? Come, Lamme, come; we will fling stones into his
web....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;we shall be burned
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to Groenendal, my dear friend; come to Groenendal, there
is a noble cloister whither His Spiderly Dukishness goes to pray to the
God of peace to allow him to perfect his work, which is to rejoice his
black spirits wallowing in carrion. We are in Lent, and it is only
blood from which His Dukishness has no mind to fast. Come, Lamme, there
are five hundred armed horsemen roundabout the house of Ohain; three
hundred footmen have set out in little bands and are entering the
forest of Soignes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently, when Alba is at his devotions, we shall run out
upon him, and having taken him, we shall put him in a good iron cage
and send him to the prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lamme, shivering in anguish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great risk, my son,&rdquo; he said to Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;A
great risk! I would follow you in this emprise were not my legs so
weak, if my belly was not so blown out by reason of the thin sour beer
they drink in this town of Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This discourse was held in a hole dug in the earth in a wood, in the
middle of the undergrowth. Suddenly, looking through the leaves as
though out of a burrow, they saw the yellow and red coats of the
Duke&rsquo;s troopers, whose weapons glittered in the sun and who were
going afoot through the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are betrayed,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>When he saw the troopers no more, he ran at top speed as far as
Ohain. The troopers let him pass <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4"
href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>without noticing him, because of
his woodcutter&rsquo;s clothes and the load of wood he carried on his
back. There he found the horsemen waiting; he spread the news, all
scattered and escaped except the sire de Bausart
d&rsquo;Armenti&egrave;res who was taken. As for the footmen that were
coming from Brussels, they could not find a single one.</p>
<p>And it was a cowardly traitor in the regiment of the Sieur de Likes
that betrayed them all.</p>
<p>The Sire de Bausart paid cruelly for the others.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went, his heart beating wildly with anguish, to see his
cruel punishment in the Cattle Market at Brussels.</p>
<p>And poor d&rsquo;Armenti&egrave;res, put upon the wheel, received
thirty-seven blows of an iron bar on legs, arms, feet, and hands, which
were broken to pieces one by one, for the murderers desired to see him
suffer terribly.</p>
<p>And he received the thirty-seventh on the breast, and of that one he
died.</p>

<p class="first">On a June day, bright and sweet, there was erected at
Brussels, on the marketplace in front of the City Hall, a scaffold
covered with black draperies, and hard by two tall stakes with iron
spiked ends. Upon the scaffold were two black cushions and a little
table on which there was a silver crucifix.</p>
<p>And on this scaffold were put to death by the sword the noble counts
of Egmont and of Hoorn. And the king inherited.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this time the Silent One gathered an army and
invaded the Low Countries from three sides.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said at a meeting of Wild Beggars at Marenhout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the advice of the Inquisitors, Philip, the king, has
declared each and every inhabitant of the Low Countries guilty of
treason through heresy, both for adherence to it and for not having
opposed it, and in consideration of this execrable crime, condemns them
all, without respect to sex or age, excepting those that are expressly
noted by name, to the penalties attached to such misdemeanours; and
that without hope of grace. The king inherits. Death is reaping
throughout the wide rich lands that border on the Northern Sea, the
country of Emden, the river Amise, the countries of Westphalia, of
Cl&egrave;ves, of Juliers and of Li&eacute;ge, the bishoprics of
Cologne and of Tr&egrave;ves, the countries of Lorraine and of France.
Death is reaping over a land of three hundred and forty leagues, in two
hundred walled cities, in a hundred and fifty villages holding city
rights, in the countryside in bourgs and plains. The king inherits.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nowise too much,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;eleven
thousand butchers to do the work. Alba calls them soldiers. And the
land of our fathers has become a charnel house whence the arts are
taking flight, which the trades abandon, whence industries are
departing to go and enrich foreigners, who allow them in their land to
worship the God of the free conscience. Death and Ruin are reaping. The
king inherits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The countries had acquired their privileges by dint of money
given to needy princes; these privileges are confiscated. They had
hoped, in accordance with the contracts entered upon and passed between
them and the sovereigns, to enjoy riches as the fruit of their labours.
They are deceived: the mason builds for the fire, the worker toils for
the thief. The king inherits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood and tears! death reaps at the stake; upon the trees
that serve as gallows all along the highways; in the open graves
wherein poor girls are thrown alive; in the judicial drownings of the
prisons, in the circles of blazing faggots within which the victims
burn by slow fire, in the wrappings of burning straw in which the
victims die in flame and smoke. The king inherits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So has willed the Pope in Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cities are bursting with spies waiting for their share of
the victims&rsquo; goods. The richer a man is, the guiltier he is. The
king inherits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the valiant men of the countries will not suffer
themselves to be slain like lambs. Among those that flee there are
armed men that take shelter in the woods. The monks had denounced them
that they might be slain and their goods seized. And so by night, by
day, by bands, like wild beasts they rush upon the cloisters, and take
back from thence the money stolen from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>poor people,
in the shape of candelabra, gold and silver shrines, pyxes, patens,
precious vases. Is not that so, good fellows? They drink from them the
wine the monks were keeping for themselves. The vases melted down or
pledged will serve for the holy war. Long live the Beggars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They harass the king&rsquo;s soldiers, slay them and strip
them, and then they flee into their dens. Day and night fires are seen
lighted and extinguished, changing place incessantly. They are the
fires of our feastings. For us the game, both fur and feather. We are
lords. The peasants give us bread and bacon when we want it. Lamme,
look at them. Raggedy, fierce, resolute, and proud eyed, they wander
about the woods with their hatchets, halberds, long swords, daggers,
pikes, lances, crossbows, arquebuses, for all weapons are good to them,
and they will never march under ensigns. Long live the Beggars!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ulenspiegel, being at Ypres, was recruiting soldiers
for the Prince: pursued by the Duke&rsquo;s catchpolls, he offered
himself as beadle to the provost of Saint Martin. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>There he had
for his companion a bellringer called Pompilius Numan, a coward of the
deepest dye, who at night took his own shadow for the devil and his
shirt for a ghost.</p>
<p>The provost was fat and plump as a hen fattened just ripe for the
spit. Ulenspiegel soon saw on what grass he grazed to make himself so
much pork. According to what he heard from the bellringer and saw with
his own eyes, the provost dined at nine and supped at four by the
clock. He stayed in bed until half-past eight; then before dinner he
went walking in his church to see if the poor-boxes were well filled.
And the half he put into his own pouch. At nine o&rsquo;clock he dined
on a bowl of milk, half a leg of mutton, a little heron pie, and
emptied five tankards of Brussels wine. At ten, sucking a few prunes
and washing them down with Orleans wine, he prayed God never to bring
him in the way of gluttony. At noon, he ate, to pass the time, a wing
and rump of a chicken. At one o&rsquo;clock, thinking of his supper, he
drained a big draught of Spanish wine; then stretching himself out on
his bed, refreshed himself with a little nap.</p>
<p>Awaking, he would eat a little salted salmon to whet his appetite,
and drink a great tankard of <i lang="nl">dobbel-knol</i> of Antwerp.
Then he would go down into the kitchen, sit down before the chimney
place and the noble wood fire that flamed in it. There he watched
roasting and browning for the abbey monks a big piece of veal or a
well-scalded little pigling, that he would have eaten more gladly than
a piece of bread. But his appetite was a little wanting. And he would
study the spit, which turned by itself like a miracle. It was the work
of Peter van Steenkiste the smith, who lived in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>castellany of Courtrai. The provost paid him
fifteen Paris livres for one of these spits.</p>
<p>Then he would go up again to his bed, and dozing upon it through
fatigue, he would wake up about three o&rsquo;clock to gulp in a little
pig jelly washed down with wine of Romagna at two hundred and forty
florins the hogshead. At three he would eat a fledgling chick with
Madeira sugar and empty two glasses of malvoisie at seventeen florins
the keg. At half-past three, he took half a pot of preserves and washed
it down with hydromel. Being now well awaked, he would take one foot in
his hand and rest in meditation.</p>
<p>The moment of supper being come, the cur&eacute; of Saint Jean would
often arrive to visit him at this succulent hour. They sometimes
disputed which could eat most fish, poultry, game, and meat. The one
that was quickest filled must pay a dish of carbonadoes for the other,
with three hot wines, four spices, and seven vegetables.</p>
<p>Thus drinking and eating, they talked together of heretics, being of
opinion anyhow that it was impossible to do away with too many of them.
And then they never fell into any quarrel, except only when they were
discussing the thirty-nine ways of making good soups with beer.</p>
<p>Then drooping their venerable heads upon their priestly paunches,
they would snore. Sometimes half waking, one of them would say that
life in this world is very sweet and that poor folk are very wrong to
complain.</p>
<p>This was the saintly man whose beadle Ulenspiegel became. He served
him well during mass, not without filling the flagons three times,
twice for himself and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>once for the provost. The ringer Pompilius
Numan helped him at it on occasion.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, who saw Pompilius so flourishing, paunchy, and full
cheeked, asked him if it was in the provost&rsquo;s service he had laid
up for himself this treasure of enviable health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, my son,&rdquo; replied Pompilius, &ldquo;but shut the
door tight for fear that one might listen to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then speaking in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that our master the provost
loveth all wines and beers, all meats and fowl, with a surpassing love.
And so he locks his meats in a cupboard and his wines in a cellar, the
keys of which are ever in his pouch. And he sleeps with his hand on
them.... By night when he sleeps I go and take his keys from his pouch
and put them back again, not without trembling, my son, for if he knew
my crime he would have me boiled alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pompilius,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;it needs not to
take all that trouble, but the keys one time only; I shall make keys on
this pattern and we shall leave the others on the paunch of the good
provost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make them, my son,&rdquo; said Pompilius.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel made the keys; as soon as he and Pompilius judged about
eight of the clock in the evening that the good provost was asleep they
would go down and take what they chose of meats and bottles.
Ulenspiegel would carry two bottles and Pompilius the meats, because
Pompilius always was trembling like a leaf, and hams and legs of mutton
do not break in falling. They took possession of fowl more than once
before they were cooked, which brought about the accusation of several
cats belonging to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>the neighbourhood, which were done to death
for the crime.</p>
<p>They went thereafter into the <i lang="en">Ketel-straat</i>, which
is the street of the <i>bona robas</i>. There they spared nothing,
giving liberally to their dears smoked beef and ham, saveloys and
poultry, and gave them wine of Orleans and Romagna to drink, and
<i lang="nl">Ingelsche bier</i>, which they called <i>ale</i> on the
other side of the sea, and which they poured in floods down the fresh
throats of the pretty ladies. And they were paid in caresses.</p>
<p>However, one morning after dinner the provost sent for both of them.
He had a formidable look, sucking a marrow bone in soup, not without
anger.</p>
<p>Pompilius was trembling in his shoes, and his belly was shaken with
fear. Ulenspiegel, keeping quiet, felt at the cellar keys in his pocket
with pleased satisfaction.</p>
<p>The provost, addressing him, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is drinking my wine and eating my fowl, is it thou,
my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this ringer,&rdquo; said the provost, pointing to
Pompilius, &ldquo;hath not he dipped his hands in this crime, for he is
pallid as a dying man, assuredly because the stolen wine is poison to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! Messire,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;you
wrongly accuse your ringer, for if he is pale, it is not from having
drunk wine, but for want of drinking enough, from which cause he is so
loosened that if he is not stopped his very soul will escape by streams
into his shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor we have always with us,&rdquo; said the provost,
taking a deep draught of wine from his tankard. &ldquo;But tell me, my
son, if thou, who hast the eyes of a lynx, hast not seen the
robbers?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will keep good watch for them, Messire Provost,&rdquo;
replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God have you both in his joy, my children,&rdquo; said
the provost, &ldquo;and live soberly. For it is from intemperance that
many evils come upon us in this vale of tears. Go in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he blessed them.</p>
<p>And he sucked another marrow bone in soup, and drank another great
draught of wine.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Pompilius went out from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This scurvy fellow,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;would not
have given you a single drop of his wine to drink. It will be blessed
bread to steal more from him still. But what ails you that you are
shivering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoes are full of water,&rdquo; said Pompilius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water dries quickly, my son,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;But be merry, to-night there will be flagon music in the
<i>Ketel-straat</i>. And we will fill up the three night watchmen, who
will watch the town with snores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was done.</p>
<p>However, they were close to Saint Martin&rsquo;s day: the church was
adorned for the feast. Ulenspiegel and Pompilius went in by night, shut
the doors close, lit all the wax candles, took a viol and bagpipe, and
began to play on these instruments all they might. And the candles
flared like suns. But that was not all. Their task being done, they
went to the provost, whom they found afoot, in spite of the late hour,
munching a thrush, drinking Rhenish wine and opening both eyes to see
the church windows lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire Provost,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel to him, &ldquo;would
you know who eats your meats and drinks your wines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this illumination,&rdquo; said the provost, pointing to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>the windows of the church. &ldquo;Ah! Lord God,
dost thou allow Master Saint Martin thus to burn, by night and without
paying, poor monks&rsquo; wax candles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is doing something besides, Messire Provost,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;but come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The provost took his crozier and followed with them; they went into
the church.</p>
<p>There, he saw, in the middle of the great nave, all the saints come
down from their niches, ranged round and as it seemed commanded by
Saint Martin, who out-topped them all by a head, and from the
forefinger of his hand, outstretched to bless, held up a roast turkey.
The others had in their hands or were lifting to their mouths pieces of
chicken or goose, sausages, hams, fish raw and cooked, and among other
things a pike weighing full fourteen pounds. And every one had at his
feet a flask of wine.</p>
<p>At this sight the provost, losing himself wholly in anger, became so
red and his face was so congested, that Pompilius and Ulenspiegel
thought he would burst, but the provost, without paying any heed to
them, went straight up to Saint Martin, threatening him as if he would
have laid the crime of the others to his charge, tore the turkey away
from his finger and struck him such heavy blows that he broke his arm,
his nose, his crozier, and his mitre.</p>
<p>As for the others, he did not spare them bangs and thumps, and more
than one under his blows laid aside arms, hands, mitre, crozier,
scythe, axes, gridirons, saw, and other emblems of dignity and of
martyrdom. Then the provost, his belly shaking in front of him, went
himself to put out all the candles with rage and speed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>He carried away all he could of hams, fowl, and sausages, and
bending beneath the load he came back to his bedchamber so doleful and
angry that he drank, draught upon draught, three great flasks of
wine.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, being well assured that he was sleeping, took away to
the <i>Ketel-straat</i> all the provost thought he had rescued, and
also all that remained in the church, not without first supping on the
best pieces. And they laid the remains and fragments at the feet of the
saints.</p>
<p>Next day Pompilius was ringing the bell for matins; Ulenspiegel went
up into the provost&rsquo;s sleeping chamber and asked him to come down
once more into the church.</p>
<p>There, showing him the broken pieces of saints and fowls, he said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire Provost, you did all in vain, they have eaten all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; replied the provost, &ldquo;they have come up to
my sleeping chamber, like robbers, and taken what I had saved. Ah,
master saints, I will complain to the Pope about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;but the procession is
the day after to-morrow, the workmen will presently be coming into the
church: if they see there all these poor mutilated saints, are you not
afraid of being accused of iconoclasm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Master Saint Martin,&rdquo; said the provost,
&ldquo;spare me the fire, I knew not what I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to Ulenspiegel, while the timid bellringer was swinging
to his bells:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could never,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;between now and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>Sunday, mend Saint Martin. What am I to do, and
what will the people say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;we must employ
an innocent subterfuge. We shall glue on a beard on the face of
Pompilius; it is always respectable, being always melancholic; we shall
dight him up with the Saint&rsquo;s mitre, alb, amice, and great cloak;
we shall enjoin upon him to stand well and fast on his pedestal, and
the people will take him for the wooden Saint Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The provost went to Pompilius who was swaying on the ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cease to ring,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and listen to me: would
you earn fifteen ducats? On Sunday, the day of the procession, you
shall be Saint Martin. Ulenspiegel will get you up properly, and if
when you are borne by your four men you make one movement or utter one
word, I will have you boiled alive in oil in the great caldron the
executioner has just had built on the market square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, I give you thanks,&rdquo; said Pompilius;
&ldquo;but you know that I find it hard to contain my water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must obey,&rdquo; replied the provost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall obey, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Pompilius, very
pitifully.</p>

<p class="first">Next day, in bright sunshine, the procession issued
forth from the church. Ulenspiegel had, as best he could, patched up
the twelve saints that balanced themselves on their pedestals between
the banners of the guilds, then came the statue of Our Lady; then the
daughters of the Virgin all clad in white and singing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>anthems;
then the archers and crossbowmen; then the nearest to the dais and
swaying more than the others, Pompilius sinking under the heavy
accoutrements of Master Saint Martin.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, having provided himself with itching powder, had
himself clothed Pompilius with his episcopal costume, had put on his
gloves and given him his crozier and taught him the Latin fashion of
blessing the people. He had also helped the priests to clothe
themselves. On some he put their stole, on others their amice, on the
deacons the alb. He ran hither and thither through the church,
restoring the folds of doublet or breeches. He admired and praised the
well-furbished weapons of the crossbowmen, and the formidable bows of
the confraternity of the archers. And on everyone he poured, on ruff,
on back or wrist, a pinch of itching powder. But the dean and the four
bearers of Saint Martin were those that got most of it. As for the
daughters of the Virgin, he spared them for the sake of their sweetness
and grace.</p>
<p>The procession went forth, banners in the wind, ensigns displayed,
in goodly order. Men and women crossed themselves as they saw it
passing. And the sun shone hot.</p>
<p>The dean was the first to feel the effect of the powder, and
scratched a little behind his ear. All, priests, archers, crossbowmen,
were scratching neck, legs, wrists, without daring to do it openly. The
four bearers were scratching, too, but the bellringer, itching worse
than any, for he was more exposed to the hot sun, did not dare even to
budge for fear of being boiled alive. Screwing up his nose, he made an
ugly grimace and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>trembled on his tottery legs, for he nearly fell
every time his bearers scratched themselves.</p>
<p>But he did not dare to move, and let his water go through fear, and
the bearers said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Saint Martin, is it going to rain now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priests were singing a hymn to Our Lady.</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Si de coe ... coe ... coe ... lo descenderes</p>
<p class="line">O sanc ... ta ... ta ... ta ... Ma ... ma ...
ria.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">For their voices shook because of the itching, which
became excessive, but they scratched themselves modestly and
parsimoniously. Even so the dean and the four bearers of Saint Martin
had their necks and wrists torn to pieces. Pompilius stayed absolutely
still, tottering on his poor legs, which were itching the most.</p>
<p>But lo on a sudden all the crossbowmen, archers, deacons, priests,
dean, and the bearers of Saint Martin stopped to scratch themselves.
The powder made the soles of Pompilius&rsquo;s feet itch, but he dared
not budge for fear of falling.</p>
<p>And the curious said that Saint Martin rolled very fierce eyes and
showed a very threatening mien to the poor populace.</p>
<p>Then the dean started the procession going again.</p>
<p>Soon the hot sun that was falling straight down on all these
processional backs and bellies made the effect of the powder
intolerable.</p>
<p>And then priests, archers, crossbowmen, deacons, and dean were seen,
like a troop of apes, stopping and scratching shamelessly wherever they
itched.</p>
<p>The daughters of the Virgin sang their hymn, and it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>was as
the angels&rsquo; singing, all those fresh pure voices mounting towards
the sky.</p>
<p>All went off wherever and however they could: the dean, still
scratching, rescued the Holy Sacrament; the pious people carried the
relics into the church; Saint Martin&rsquo;s four bearers threw
Pompilius roughly on the ground. There, not daring to scratch, move, or
speak, the poor bellringer shut his eyes devoutly.</p>
<p>Two lads would have carried him away, but finding him too heavy,
they stood him upright against a wall, and there Pompilius shed big
tears.</p>
<p>The populace assembled round about him; the women had gone to fetch
handkerchiefs of fine white linen and wiped his face to preserve his
tears as relics, and said to him: &ldquo;Monseigneur, how hot you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bellringer looked at them piteously, and in spite of himself,
made grimaces with his nose.</p>
<p>But as the tears were rolling copiously from his eyes, the women
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Saint Martin, are you weeping for the sins of the town
of Ypres? Is not that your honoured nose moving? Yet we have followed
the counsel of Louis Viv&egrave;s and the poor of Ypres will have
wherewithal to work and wherewithal to eat. Oh! the big tears! They are
pearls. Our salvation is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we, great Saint Martin, pull down the
<i>Ketel-straat</i> in our town? But teach us above all ways of
preventing poor girls from going out at night and so falling into a
thousand adventures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the people cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the beadle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then came up, and taking Pompilius <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>round
the body, carried him off on his shoulders followed by the crowd of
devout men and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the poor ringer, whispering in his ear,
&ldquo;I shall die of itch, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep stiff,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;do you forget
that you are a wooden saint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran on at full speed and set down Pompilius before the provost
who was currying himself with his nails till the blood came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bellringer,&rdquo; said the provost, &ldquo;have you
scratched yourself like us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Messire,&rdquo; answered Pompilius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you spoken or moved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Messire,&rdquo; replied Pompilius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the provost, &ldquo;you shall have your
fifteen ducats. Now go and scratch yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The next day, the people, having learned from
Ulenspiegel what had happened, said it was a wicked mockery to make
them worship as a saint a whining fellow who could not hold in his
water.</p>
<p>And many became heretics. And setting out with all their goods, they
hastened to swell the prince&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel returned towards Li&eacute;ge.</p>
<p>Being alone in the wood he sat down and pondered. Looking at the
bright sky, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;War, always war, so that the Spanish enemy may slay the poor
people, pillage our goods, violate our wives and daughters. And all the
while our goodly money goes, and our blood flows in rivers without
profit to any one, except for this royal churl that would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>fain add
another jewel of authority to his crown. A jewel that he imagines
glorious, a jewel of blood, a jewel of smoke. Ah! if I could jewel thee
as I desire, there would be none but flies to desire thy
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he thought on these things he saw pass before him a whole herd of
stags. There were some among them old and tall, with their dowcets
still, and proudly wearing their antlers with nine points. Graceful
brockets, which are their squires, trotted alongside them seeming all
prepared to give them succour with their pointed horns. Ulenspiegel
knew not where they were going, but judged that it was to their
lair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;old stags and graceful brockets,
ye are going, merry and proud, into the depths of the woodland to your
lair, eating the young shoots, snuffling up the balmy scents, happy
until the hunter-murderer shall come. Even so with us, old stags and
brockets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the ashes of Claes beat upon Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s breast.</p>

<p class="first">In September, when the gnats cease from biting, the
Silent One, with six field guns and four great cannon to talk for him,
and fourteen thousand Flemings, Walloons, and Germans, crossed the
Rhine at Saint Vyt.</p>
<p>Under the yellow-and-red ensigns of the knotty staff of Burgundy, a
staff that bruised our countries for long, the rod of the beginning of
servitude that Alba wielded, the bloody duke, there marched twenty-six
thousand five hundred men, and rumbled along seventeen field pieces and
nine big guns.</p>
<p>But the Silent One was not to have any good success in this war, for
Alba continually refused battle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"

<p>And his brother Ludwig, the Bayard of Flanders, after many cities
won, and many ships held to ransom on the Rhine, lost at Jemmingen in
Frisia to the duke&rsquo;s son sixteen guns, fifteen hundred horses,
and twenty ensigns, all through certain cowardly mercenary troops, who
demanded money when it was the hour of battle.</p>
<p>And through ruin, blood, and tears, Ulenspiegel vainly sought the
salvation of the land of our fathers.</p>
<p>And the executioners throughout the countries were hanging,
beheading, burning the poor innocent victims.</p>
<p>And the king was inheriting.</p>

<h2 id="xd20e717" class="main">X</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Going through the Walloon country, Ulenspiegel saw
that the prince had no succour to hope for thence, and so he came up to
the town of Bouillon.</p>
<p>Little by little he saw appearing on the road more and more
hunchbacks of every age, sex, and condition. All of them, equipped with
large rosaries, were devoutly telling their beads on them.</p>
<p>And their prayers were as the croakings of frogs in a pond at night
when the weather is warm.</p>
<p>There were hunchback mothers carrying hunchback children, whilst
other children of the same brood clung to their skirts. And there were
hunchbacks on the hills and hunchbacks in the plains. And everywhere
Ulenspiegel saw their thin silhouettes standing out against the clear
sky.</p>
<p>He went to one and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither go all these poor men, women, and
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man replied: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to the tomb of Master Saint Remacle to pray him
that he will grant what our hearts desire, by taking from off our backs
his lump of humiliation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel rejoined:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could Master Saint Remacle give me also what my heart
desireth, by taking from off the back of the poor communes the bloody
duke, who weighs upon them like a leaden hump?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hath not charge to remove humps of penance,&rdquo; replied
the pilgrim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he remove others?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, when the humps are young. If then the miracle of healing
takes place, we hold revel and feasting throughout all the town. And
every pilgrim gives a piece of silver, and oftentimes a gold florin to
the happy one that is cured, becomes a saint thereby and with power to
pray with efficacy for the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doeth the wealthy Master Saint Remacle, like a rascal
apothecary, make folk pay for his cures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impious tramp, he punishes blasphemers!&rdquo; replied the
pilgrim, shaking his hump in fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; groaned Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And he fell doubled up at the foot of a tree.</p>
<p>The pilgrim, looking down on him, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Saint Remacle smites hard when he smites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel bent up his back, and scratching at it, whined:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious saint, take pity. It is chastisement. I feel between
my shoulder bones a bitter agony. Alas! O! O! Pardon, Master Saint
Remacle. Go, pilgrim, go, leave me here alone, like a parricide, to
weep and to repent.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the pilgrim had fled away as far as the Great Square of
Bouillon, where all the hunchbacks were gathered.</p>
<p>There, shivering with fear, he told them, speaking brokenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Met a pilgrim as straight as a poplar ... a blaspheming
pilgrim ... hump on his back ... a burning hump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilgrims, hearing this, they gave vent to a thousand joyful
outcries, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Saint Remacle, if you give humps, you can take them
away. Take away our humps, Master Saint Remacle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ulenspiegel left his tree. Passing through the empty
suburb, he saw, at the low door of a tavern, two bladders swinging from
a stick, pigs&rsquo; bladders, hung up in this fashion as a sign of a
fair of black puddings, <i>panch kermis</i> as they say in the country
of Brabant.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel took one of the two bladders, picked up from the ground
the backbone of a <i>schol</i>, which the French call dried plaice,
drew blood from himself, made some blood run into the bladder, blew it
up, sealed it, put it on his back, and on it placed the backbone of the
<i>schol</i>. Thus equipped, with his back arched, his head wagging,
and his legs tottering like an old humpback, he came out on the
square.</p>
<p>The pilgrim that had witnessed his fall saw him and cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the blasphemer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And pointed to him with his finger. And all ran to see the afflicted
one.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel nodded his head piteously. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I deserve neither grace nor pity;
slay me like a mad dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the humpbacks, rubbing their hands, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more in our fraternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, muttering between his teeth: &ldquo;I will make you pay
for that, evil ones,&rdquo; appeared to endure all patiently, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will neither eat nor drink, even to fortify my hump, until
Master Saint Remacle has deigned to heal me even as he has smitten
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the rumour of the miracle the dean came out of the church. He was
a tall man, portly and majestic. Nose in wind, he clove the sea of the
hunchbacks like a ship.</p>
<p>They pointed out Ulenspiegel; he said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it thou, good fellow, that the scourge of Saint Remacle
has smitten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, Messire Dean,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;it is
indeed I his humble worshipper who would fain be cured of his new hump,
if it please him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean, smelling some trick under this speech:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;feel this hump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel it, Messire,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And having done so, the dean:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of recent date and wet. I hope,
however, that Master Saint Remacle will be pleased to act pitifully.
Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel followed the dean and went into the church. The
humpbacks, walking behind him, cried out: &ldquo;Behold the accursed!
Behold the blasphemer! What doth it weigh, thy fresh hump? Wilt thou
make a bag of it to put thy patacoons in? Thou didst mock at us all thy
life because thou wast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26"
name="pb26">26</a>]</span>straight: now it is our turn. Glory be to
Master Saint Remacle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, without uttering a word, bending his head, still
following the dean, went into a little chapel where there was a tomb
all marble covered with a great flat slab also of marble. Between the
tomb and the chapel wall there was not the space of the span of a large
hand. A crowd of humpbacked pilgrims, following one another in single
file, passed between the wall and the slab of the tomb, on which they
rubbed their humps in silence. And thus they hoped to be delivered. And
those that were rubbing their humps were loath to give place to those
that had not yet rubbed theirs, and they fought together, but without
any noise, only daring to strike sly blows, humpbacks&rsquo; blows,
because of the holiness of the place.</p>
<p>The dean bade Ulenspiegel get up on the flat top of the tomb, that
all the pilgrims might see him plainly. Ulenspiegel replied: &ldquo;I
cannot get up by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean helped him up and stationed himself beside him, bidding him
kneel down. Ulenspiegel did so and remained in this posture, with head
hanging.</p>
<p>The dean then, having meditated, preached and said in a sonorous
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sons and brothers of Jesus Christ, ye see at my feet the
greatest child of impiety, vagabond, and blasphemer that Saint Remacle
hath ever smitten with his anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel, beating upon his breast, said: &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Confiteor</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; went on the dean, &ldquo;he was straight as a
halberd shaft, and gloried in it. See him now, humpbacked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>and
bowed under the stroke of the celestial curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Confiteor</i>, take away my hump,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; went on the dean, &ldquo;yea, mighty saint,
Master Saint Remacle, who since thy glorious death hast performed nine
and thirty miracles, take away from his shoulders the weight that loads
them down. And may we, for this boon, sing thy praises from everlasting
to everlasting, <i>in saecula saeculorum</i>. And peace on earth to
humpbacks of good will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the humpbacks said in chorus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, yea, peace on earth to humpbacks of good will:
humpbacks&rsquo; peace, truce to the deformed, amnesty of humiliation.
Take away our humps, Master Saint Remacle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean bade Ulenspiegel descend from the tomb, and rub his hump
against the edge of the slab. Ulenspiegel did so, ever repeating:
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Mea culpa, confiteor</i>, take away my hump.&rdquo;
And he rubbed it thoroughly in sight and knowledge of those that stood
by.</p>
<p>And these cried aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye see the hump? it bends! see you, it gives way! it will
melt away on the right&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, it will go back into the
breast; humps do not melt, they go down again into the intestines from
which they come&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, they return into the stomach
where they serve as nourishment for eighty days&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
is the saint&rsquo;s gift to humpbacks that are rid of
them&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Where do the old humps go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly all the humpbacks gave a loud cry, for Ulenspiegel had just
burst his hump leaning hard against the edge of the flat tomb top. All
the blood that was in it fell, dripping from his doublet in big
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>drops upon the stone flags. And he cried out,
straightening himself up and stretching out his arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rid of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the humpbacks began to call out together:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Saint Remacle the blessed, it is kind to him, but hard
to us&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Master, take away our humps, ours
too!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I, I will give thee a
calf.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I, seven sheep.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I, the
year&rsquo;s hunting.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I, six
hams.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I, I will give my cottage to the
Church&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take away our humps, Master Saint
Remacle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they looked on Ulenspiegel with envy and with respect. One would
have felt under his doublet, but the dean said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a wound that may not see the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pray for you,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, Pilgrim,&rdquo; said the humpbacks, speaking all
together, &ldquo;aye, master, thou that hast been made straight again,
we made a mock of thee; forgive it us, we knew not what we did.
Monseigneur Christ forgave when on the cross; give us all
forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will forgive,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel benevolently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;take this patard, accept this
florin, permit us to give this real to Your Straightness, to offer him
this cruzado, put these carolus in his hands....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide up your carolus,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, whispering,
&ldquo;let not your left hand know what your right hand is
giving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this he said because of the dean who was devouring with his eyes
the humpbacks&rsquo; money, without seeing whether it was gold or
silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be unto thee, sanctified sir,&rdquo; said the
humpbacks to Ulenspiegel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he accepted their gifts proudly as a man of a miracle.</p>
<p>But greedy ones were rubbing away with their humps on the tomb
without saying a word.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went at night to a tavern where he held revel and
feast.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, thinking that the dean would want to have his
share of the booty, if not all, he counted up his gain, and found more
gold than silver, for he had in it fully three hundred carolus. He
noted a withered bay tree in a pot, took it by the hair of its head,
plucked up the plant and the earth, and put the gold underneath. All
the demi-florins, patards, and patacoons were spread out upon the
table.</p>
<p>The dean came to the tavern and went up to Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The latter, seeing him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire Dean,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what would you of my
poor self?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but thy good, my son,&rdquo; replied he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; groaned Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;is it that which you
see on the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; replied the dean.</p>
<p>Then putting out his hand, he swept the table clean of all the money
that was upon it and dropped it into a bag destined for it.</p>
<p>And he gave a florin to Ulenspiegel, who pretended to groan and
whine.</p>
<p>And he asked for the implements of the miracle.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel showed him the <i>schol</i> bone and the bladder.</p>
<p>The dean took them while Ulenspiegel bemoaned himself, imploring him
to be good enough to give him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>more, saying that the way was long
from Bouillon to Damme, for him a poor footpassenger, and that beyond a
doubt he would die of hunger.</p>
<p>The dean went away without uttering a word.</p>
<p>Being left alone, Ulenspiegel went to sleep with his eye on the bay
tree. Next day at dawn, having picked up his booty, he went away from
Bouillon and went to the camp of the Silent One, handed over the money
to him and recounted the story, saying it was the true method of
levying contributions of war from the enemy.</p>
<p>And the Prince gave him ten florins.</p>
<p>As for the <i>schol</i> bone, it was enshrined in a crystal casket
and placed between the arms of the cross on the principal altar at
Bouillon.</p>
<p>And everyone in the town knows that what the cross encloses is the
hump of the blasphemer who was made straight.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Silent One, being in the neighbourhood of
Li&eacute;ge, made marches and countermarches before crossing the
Meuse, thus misleading the duke&rsquo;s vigilance.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, schooling himself to his duties as a soldier, became
very dexterous in handling the wheel-locked arquebus and kept his eyes
and ears well open.</p>
<p>At this time there came to the camp Flemish and Brabant nobles, who
lived on good terms with the lords, colonels, and captains in the
following of the Silent One.</p>
<p>Soon two parties formed in the camp, eternally quarrelling and
disputing, the one side saying: &ldquo;the Prince is a traitor,&rdquo;
the other answering that the accusers lied <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>in their
throat and that they would make them swallow their lie. Distrust spread
and grew like a spot of oil. They came to blows in groups of six, of
eight, or a dozen men; fighting with every weapon of single combat,
even with arquebuses.</p>
<p>One day the prince came up at the noise, marching between two
parties. A bullet carried away his sword from his side. He put an end
to the combat and visited the whole camp to show himself, that it might
not be said: &ldquo;The Silent One is dead, and the war is dead with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, towards midnight, in misty weather, Ulenspiegel being
on the point of coming out from a house where he had been to sing a
Flemish love song to a Walloon girl, heard at the door of the cottage
beside the house a raven&rsquo;s croak thrice repeated. Other croakings
answered from a distance, thrice by thrice. A country churl came to the
door of the cottage. Ulenspiegel heard footsteps on the highway.</p>
<p>Two men, speaking Spanish, came to the rustic, who said to them in
the same tongue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good piece of work,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;lying for the
king. Thanks to us, captains and soldiermen say to one another in
distrust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is through vile ambition that the prince is
resisting the king; he is but waiting to be feared by him and to
receive cities and lordships as a pledge of peace; for five hundred
thousand florins he will abandon the valiant lords that are fighting
for the countries. The duke has offered him a full amnesty with a
promise and an oath to restore to their estates himself and all the
highest leaders of the army, if they would re-enter <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>into
obedience to the king. Orange means to treat with him alone by
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The partisans of the Silent One answered us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The duke&rsquo;s offer is a treacherous trap. He will
pay them no heed, recalling the fate of Messieurs d&rsquo;Egmont and de
Hoorn. Well they know it, Cardinal de Granvelle, being at Rome, said at
the time of the capture of the Counts: &ldquo;They take the two
gudgeons, but they leave the pike; they have taken nothing since the
Silent remains still to take.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the variance great in the camp?&rdquo; said the
rustic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great is the variance,&rdquo; said they: &ldquo;greater every
day. Where are the letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the cottage, where a lantern was lighted. There,
peeping through a little skylight, Ulenspiegel saw them open two
missives, read them with much satisfaction and pleasure, drink
hydromel, and at last depart, saying to the rustic in Spanish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camp divided, Orange taken. That will be a good
lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;cannot be
allowed to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out into the thick mist. Ulenspiegel saw the rustic bring
them a lantern, which they took with them.</p>
<p>The light of the lantern being often intercepted by a black shape,
he took it that they were walking one behind the other.</p>
<p>He primed his arquebus and fired at the black shape. He then saw the
lantern lowered and raised several times, and judged that, one of the
two being down, the other was endeavouring to see the nature of his
wound. He primed his arquebus again. Then the lantern <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>going
forward alone, swiftly and swinging and in the direction of the camp,
he fired once more. The lantern staggered about, then fell, and there
was darkness.</p>
<p>Running towards the camp, he saw the provost coming out with a crowd
of soldiers awakened by the noise of the shots. Ulenspiegel, accosting
them, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the hunter, go and pick up the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jolly Fleming,&rdquo; said the provost, &ldquo;you speak
otherwise than with your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tongue talk, &rsquo;tis wind,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;Lead talk remains in the bodies of the traitors. But follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought them, furnished with their lanterns, to the place where
the two were fallen. And they beheld them indeed, stretched out on the
earth, one dead, the other in the death rattle and holding his hand on
his breast, where there was a letter crushed and crumpled in the last
effort of his life.</p>
<p>They carried away the bodies, which they recognized by their
garments as bodies of nobles, and thus came with their lanterns to the
prince, interrupted at council with Frederic of Hollenhausen, the
Markgrave of Hesse, and other lords.</p>
<p>Followed by landsknechts, reiters, green jackets and yellow jackets,
they came before the tent of the Silent, shouting requests that he
would receive them.</p>
<p>He came from the tent. Then, taking the word from the provost who
was coughing and preparing to accuse him, Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, I have killed two traitor nobles of your train,
instead of ravens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he recounted what he had seen, heard, and done. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Silent said not a word. The two bodies were searched, there
being present himself, William of Orange, the Silent, Frederic de
Hollenhausen, the Markgrave of Hesse, Dieterich de Schooenbergh, Count
Albert of Nassau, the Count de Hoogstraeten, Antoine de Lalaing, the
Governor of Malines; the troopers, and Lamme Goedzak trembling in his
great paunch. Sealed letters from Granvelle and Noircarmes were found
upon the gentlemen, enjoining upon them to sow dissension in the
prince&rsquo;s train, in order to diminish his strength by so much, to
force him to yield, and to deliver him to the duke to be beheaded in
accordance with his deserts. &ldquo;It was essential,&rdquo; said the
letters, &ldquo;to proceed subtly and by veiled speech, so that the
people in the army might believe that the Silent had already, for his
own personal profit, come to a private agreement with the duke. His
captains and soldiers, being angry, would make him a prisoner. For
reward a draft on the F&uuml;ggers of Antwerp for five hundred ducats
had been sent to each; they should have a thousand as soon as the four
hundred thousand ducats that were expected should have arrived in
Zealand from Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plot being discovered and laid open, the prince, without a
word, turned towards the nobles, lords, and soldiers, among whom were a
great many that held him in suspicion; he showed the two corpses
without a word, intending thereby to reproach them for their mistrust
of him. All shouted with a great tumultuous noise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long life to Orange! Orange is faithful to the
countries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They would, for contumely, fain have flung the bodies to the dogs,
but the Silent: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not bodies that must be thrown to the dogs, but
feeblemindedness that bringeth about doubts of singleminded and good
intents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And lords and soldiers shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the prince! Long live Orange, the friend to the
countries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And their voices were as a thunder threatening injustice.</p>
<p>And the prince, pointing to the bodies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them Christian interment,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;what is to be done
with my faithful carcase? If I have done ill let them give me blows; if
I have done well let them accord me reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Silent One spake and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This musketeer shall have fifty blows with green wood in my
presence for having, without orders, slain two nobles, to the great
disparagement of all discipline. He shall receive as well thirty
florins for having seen well and heard well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;if they gave
me the thirty florins first, I would endure the blows from the green
wood with patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; groaned Lamme Goedzak, &ldquo;give him first
of all the thirty florins; he will endure the rest with
patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;having my soul free
of guilt, I have no need to be washed with oak or rinsed with
cornel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; groaned Lamme Goedzak as before,
&ldquo;Ulenspiegel hath no need of washing or of rinsing. He hath a
clean soul. Do not wash him, Messires, do not wash him.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ulenspiegel having received the thirty florins, the <i lang=
"nl">stock-meester</i> was ordered by the provost to seize him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Messires,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;how piteous he
looks. He hath no love for the wood, my friend Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;to see a lovely
ash all leafy, growing in the sunshine in all it&rsquo;s native
verdure; but I hate to the death those ugly sticks of wood still
bleeding their sap, stripped of branches, without leaves or twigs, of
fierce aspect and harsh of acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou ready?&rdquo; asked the provost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; repeated Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;ready for what? To
be beaten. No, I am not, and have no desire to be, master <i lang=
"nl">stock-meester</i>. Your beard is red and you have a formidable
air; but I am fully persuaded that you have a kind heart and do not
love to maltreat a poor fellow like me. I must tell it you, I love not
to do it or see it; for a Christian man&rsquo;s back is a sacred temple
which, even as his breast, encloseth the lungs wherewith we breathe the
air of the good God. With what poignant remorse would you be gnawed if
a brutal stroke of the stick were to break me in pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; said the <i lang=
"nl">stock-meester</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, speaking to the Prince,
&ldquo;nothing presses, believe me; first should this stick be dried
and seasoned, for they say that green wood entering living flesh
imparts to it a deadly venom. Would Your Highness wish to see me die of
this foul death? Monseigneur, I hold my faithful back at Your
Highness&rsquo; service; have it beaten with rods, lashed with the
whip; but, if you would not see me dead, spare me, if it please you,
the green wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince, give him grace,&rdquo; said Messire de Hoogstraeten
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>and Dieterich de Schooenbergh. The others smiled
pityingly.</p>
<p>Lamme also said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, Monseigneur, show grace; green wood it is pure
poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince then said: &ldquo;I pardon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, leaping several times high in air, struck on
Lamme&rsquo;s belly and forced him to dance, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise Monseigneur with me, who saved me from the green
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme tried to dance, but could not, because of his belly.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel treated him to both eating and drinking.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Not wishing to give battle, the duke without truce or
respite harried the Silent as he wandered about the flat land between
Juliers and the Meuse, everywhere sounding the river at Hondt,
Mechelen, Elsen, Meersen, and everywhere finding it filled with traps
and caltrops to wound men and horses that sought to pass over by
fording.</p>
<p>At Stockem, the sounders found none of these engines. The prince
gave orders for crossing. The reiters went over the Meuse and held
themselves in battle order on the other bank, so as to protect the
crossing on the side of the bishopric of Li&eacute;ge; then there
formed up in line from one bank to the other, in this way breaking the
current of the river, ten ranks of archers and musketeers, among whom
was Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>He had water up to his thighs, and often some treacherous wave would
lift him up, himself and his horse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>He saw the foot soldiers cross, carrying a powder bag upon their
headgear and holding their muskets high in air: then came the wagons,
the hackbuts, linstocks, culverins, double culverins, falcons,
falconets, serpentines, demi-serpentines, double serpentines, mortars,
double mortars, cannon, demi-cannon, double cannon, <i>sacres</i>,
little field pieces mounted on carriages drawn by two horses, able to
man&oelig;uvre at the gallop and in every way like those that were
nicknamed the Emperor&rsquo;s Pistols; behind them, protecting the
rear, landsknechts and reiters from Flanders.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel looked about to find some warming drink. The archer
Riesencraft, a High German, a lean, cruel, gigantic fellow, was snoring
on his charger beside him, and as he breathed he spread abroad the
perfume of brandy. Ulenspiegel, spying for a flask on his horse&rsquo;s
crupper, found it hung behind on a cord like a baldric, which he cut,
and he took the flask, and drank rejoicing. The archer companions said
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so. The brandy being drunk, he knotted the cord that held the
flask, and would have put it back about the soldier&rsquo;s breast. As
he lifted his arm to pass it round, Riesencraft awoke. Taking the
flask, he would have milked his cow as usual. Finding that it gave no
more milk, he fell into mighty anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robber,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what have you done with my
brandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunk it. Among soaking horsemen, one man&rsquo;s brandy is
everybody&rsquo;s brandy. Evil is the scurvy stingy one.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I will carve your carcase in the lists,&rdquo;
replied Riesencraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will carve each other,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;heads, arms, legs, and all. But are you not constipated, that
you have such a sour face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Riesencraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want a purge, then,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;and not a duel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was agreed between them that they should meet next day, mounted
and accoutred each as he pleased, and should cut up each other&rsquo;s
bacon with a short stiff sword.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel asked that for himself the sword might be replaced by a
cudgel, which was granted him.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, all the soldiers having crossed the river and
falling into order at the voice of the colonels and the captains, the
ten ranks of archers also crossed over.</p>
<p>And the Silent said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us march on Li&eacute;ge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was glad of this, and with all the Flemings, shouted
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long life to Orange, let us march on Li&eacute;ge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the foreigners, and notably the High Germans, said they were too
much washed and rinsed to march. Vainly did the prince assure them that
they were going to a certain victory, to a friendly city; they would
listen to nothing, but lit great fires and warmed themselves in front
of them, with their horses unharnessed.</p>
<p>The attack on the city was put off till next day when Alba, greatly
astonished at the bold crossing, learned through his spies that the
Silent One&rsquo;s soldiers were not yet ready for the assault.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thereupon, he threatened Li&eacute;ge and all the country round
about to put them to fire and sword, if the prince&rsquo;s friends made
any movement there. Gerard de Groesbeke, the bishop&rsquo;s catchpoll,
armed his troopers against the prince, who arrived too late, through
the fault of the High Germans, who were afraid of a little water in
their stockings.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ulenspiegel and Riesencraft having taken seconds, the
latter said that the two soldiers were to fight on foot to the death,
if the conqueror wished, for such were Riesencraft&rsquo;s
conditions.</p>
<p>The scene of the conflict was a little heath.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Riesencraft donned his archer&rsquo;s array.
He put on his salade with the throat piece, without visor, and a mail
shirt with no sleeves. His other shirt being fallen into pieces, he put
it in his salade to make lint of it if need was. He armed himself with
an arbalest of good Ardennes wood, a sheaf of thirty quarrels, with
a long dagger, but not with a two-handed sword, which is the
archer&rsquo;s sword. And he came to the field of battle mounted upon
his charger, carrying his war saddle and the plumed chamfron, and all
barded with iron.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel made up for himself an armament for a nobleman; his
charger was a donkey; his saddle was the petticoat of a gay wench, his
plumed chamfron was of osier, adorned above with goodly fluttering
shavings. His barde was bacon, for, said he, iron costs too much, steel
is beyond price, and as for brass in these later days, they have made
so many cannon out of it that there is not enough left to arm a rabbit
for battle. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>donned for headgear a fine salade that had not yet
been devoured by the snails; this salade was surmounted by a
swan&rsquo;s feather, to make him sing if he was killed.</p>
<p>His sword, stiff and light, was a good long, stout cudgel of
pinewood, at the end of which there was a besom of branches of the same
tree. On the left hand of his saddle hung his knife, which was of wood
likewise; on the right swung his good mace, which was of elderwood,
surmounted with a turnip. His cuirass was all holes and flaws.</p>
<p>When he arrived in this array, at the field of the duel,
Riesencraft&rsquo;s seconds burst out laughing, but he himself remained
unbending from his sour face.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s seconds then demanded of Riesencraft&rsquo;s
that the German should lay aside his armour of mail and iron, seeing
that Ulenspiegel was armed only in rags and pieces. To which
Riesencraft gave consent. Riesencraft&rsquo;s seconds then asked
Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s how it came that Ulenspiegel was armed with a
besom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You granted me the stick, but you did not forbid me to
enliven it with foliage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you think fit,&rdquo; said the four seconds.</p>
<p>Riesencraft said never a word and cropped down with little strokes
of his sword the thin stalks of the heather.</p>
<p>The seconds requested him to replace his sword with a besom, the
same as Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this rascal of his own accord chose a weapon so out of the
way, it is because he imagines he can defend his life with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel saying again that he would use his besom, the four
seconds agreed that everything was in order. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>They were set facing each other, Riesencraft on his horse barded
with iron, Ulenspiegel on his donkey barded with bacon.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel came forward into the middle of the field of combat.
There, holding his besom like a lance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deem,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;fouler and more stinking than
plague, leprosy, and death, this vermin brood of ill fellows who, in a
camp of old soldiers and boon companions, have no other thought than to
carry round everywhere their scowling faces and their mouths foaming
with anger. Wherever they may be, laughter dares not show itself, and
songs are silent. They must be forever growling and fighting,
introducing thus alongside of legitimate combat for the fatherland
single combat which is the ruin of an army and the delight of the
enemy. Riesencraft here present hath slain for mere innocent words one
and twenty men, without ever performing in battle or skirmish any act
of distinguished bravery or deserved the least reward by his courage.
Now it is my pleasure to-day to brush the bare hide of this crabbed dog
the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riesencraft replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This drunkard has had tall dreams of the abuse of single
combats: it will be my pleasure to-day to split his head, to show
everybody that he has nothing but hay in his brain-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seconds made them get down from their mounts. In so doing
Ulenspiegel dropped from his head the salad which the ass ate quietly
and slyly; but the donkey was interrupted in this job by a kick from
one of the seconds to make him get out of the duelling enclosure. The
same treatment fell to the lot of the horse. And they went off
elsewhere to graze in company. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the seconds, carrying broom&mdash;these were
Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s pair, and the others, carrying sword&mdash;they
were Riesencraft&rsquo;s, gave the signal for the fray with a
whistle.</p>
<p>And Riesencraft and Ulenspiegel fell to fighting furiously,
Riesencraft smiting with his sword, Ulenspiegel parrying with his
besom; Riesencraft swearing by all devils, Ulenspiegel fleeing before
him, wandering through the heather obliquely and circling, zigzagging,
thrusting out his tongue, making a thousand other faces at Riesencraft,
who was losing his breath and beating the air with his sword like a mad
trooper. Ulenspiegel felt him close, turned sharp and sudden, and gave
him a great whack under the nose with his besom. Riesencraft fell down
with arms and legs stretched out like a dying frog.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel flung himself upon him, besomed his face up and down and
every way, pitilessly, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry for mercy or I make you swallow my besom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he rubbed and scrubbed him without ceasing, to the great
pleasure and joy of the spectators, and still said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry for mercy or I make you eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Riesencraft could not cry, for he was dead of black rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God have thy soul, poor madman!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And he went away, plunged in melancholy.</p>

money; his army was hungry. The soldiers were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>murmuring; he marched in the direction of France
and offered battle to the duke, who declined it.</p>
<p>Leaving Quesnoy-le-Comte to go towards Cambr&eacute;sis, he met ten
companies of Germans, eight ensigns of Spaniards, and three cornets of
light horse, commanded by Don Ruffele Henricis, the duke&rsquo;s son,
who was in the middle of the line, and cried in Spanish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill! Kill! No quarter. Long live the Pope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Henricis was then over against the company of musketeers in
which Ulenspiegel was <i>dizenier</i>, in command of ten men, and
hurled himself upon them with his men. Ulenspiegel said to the sergeant
of his troop:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to cut the tongue out of this ruffian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut away,&rdquo; said the sergeant.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel, with a well-aimed bullet, smashed the tongue and
the jaw of Don Ruffele Henricis, the duke&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel brought down from his horse the son of Marquis
Delmar&egrave;s also.</p>
<p>The eight ensigns, the three cornets were beaten.</p>
<p>After this victory, Ulenspiegel sought for Lamme in the camp, but
found him not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there he is, gone, my friend
Lamme, my big friend. In his warlike ardour, forgetting the weight of
his belly, he must have pursued the flying Spaniards. Out of breath he
will have fallen like a sack upon the road. And they will have picked
him up to have ransom for him, a ransom for Christian bacon. My friend
Lamme, where art thou then, where art thou, my fat friend?&rdquo;

<p class="first">In November, the month of snow storms, the Silent sent
for Ulenspiegel to come before him. The prince was biting at the cord
of his mail shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken and understand,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ears are prison doors; to enter is easy, but it is a hard
business to get anything out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Silent said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go through Namur, Flanders, Hainaut, Sud-Brabant, Antwerp,
Nord-Brabant, Guelder, Overyssel, Nord-Holland, announcing everywhere
that if fortune betrays our holy and Christian cause by land, the
struggle against every unjust violence will continue on the sea. May
God direct this matter with all grace, whether in good or evil fortune.
Once come to Amsterdam, you shall give account to Paul Buys, my trusty
friend, of all you have done and performed. Here are three passes,
signed by Alba himself, and found upon the bodies at Quesnoy-le-Comte.
My secretary has filled them. Perchance you will find on the way some
good comrade in whom you may be able to trust. Those are good folk who
to the lark&rsquo;s note answer with the warlike bugle of the cock.
Here are fifty florins. You will be valiant and faithful.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">He had, under the hand of the king and the duke,
license to carry all weapons at his own convenience. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>He took
his good wheel-lock arquebus, cartridges, and dry powder. Then clad in
a ragged short cloak, a tattered doublet, and breeches full of holes in
the Spanish fashion, wearing a bonnet with plume flying in the wind,
and sword, he left the army near the French frontier and marched off
towards Maestricht.</p>
<p>The wrens, those heralds of the cold, flew about the houses, asking
shelter. The third day it snowed.</p>
<p>Many times and oft on the way Ulenspiegel must needs show his safe
conduct. He was allowed to pass. He marched towards Li&eacute;ge.</p>
<p>He had just entered into a plain; a great wind drove whirls of
flakes upon his face. Before him he saw the plain stretch out all
white, and the eddies of snow driven hither and thither by the gusts.
Three wolves followed him, but when he knocked one over with his
musket, the others flung themselves on the wounded one and made off
into the woods, each carrying a great piece of the corpse.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel being thus delivered, and looking to see if there was no
other band in the country, saw at the end of the plain specks as it
were gray statues moving among the eddies, and behind them shapes of
mounted soldiers. He climbed up into a tree. The wind brought a far-off
noise of complaining: &ldquo;These are perchance,&rdquo; he said to
himself, &ldquo;pilgrims clad in white coats; I can scarcely see their
bodies against the snow.&rdquo; Then he distinguished men running naked
and saw two reiters, harnessed all in black, who sitting on their
chargers were driving this poor flock before them with great blows of
their whips. He primed his musket. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>Among these wretches he saw
young folk, old men naked with teeth chattering, frozen, huddled up,
and running to escape the whips of the two troopers, who took a
delight, being well clad, red with brandy and good food, in lashing the
bodies of the naked men to make them run quicker.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said: &ldquo;Ye shall have vengeance, ashes of
Claes.&rdquo; And he killed, with a bullet in the face, one of the
reiters, who fell down from his horse. The other, not knowing from
whence had come that unlooked-for bullet, took fright. Thinking there
were enemies hidden in the wood, he would fain have fled with his
comrade&rsquo;s horse. While he dismounted to despoil the dead man, and
had taken hold of the bridle, he was stricken with another bullet in
the neck and fell, like his companion.</p>
<p>The naked men, believing that an angel from heaven, a good
arquebusier, had come to their rescue, fell upon their knees.
Ulenspiegel came down from his tree and was recognized by those in the
band who had, like him, served in the prince&rsquo;s army. They said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel, we are of the land of France, sent in state to
Maestricht where the duke is, there to be treated as rebel prisoners,
unable to pay ransom and condemned in advance to be tortured, beheaded,
or to row like ruffians and robbers on the king&rsquo;s
galleys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, giving his <i lang="nl">opperst kleed</i> to the oldest
of the band, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I will fetch you as far as M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, but
first of all we must strip these two troopers and take their horses
with us.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>The doublets, breeches, boots, and headgear and cuirasses of the
troopers were divided among the weakest and most ailing, and
Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go into the wood, where the air is thicker and
milder. Let us run, brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a man fell and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am cold and I am hungry, and I go before God to bear
witness that the Pope is Antichrist on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he died. And the others were fain to bear him away with them, in
order to give him a Christian burial.</p>
<p>While they were journeying along a main road they perceived a
countryman driving a wagon covered with its canvas tilt. Seeing the
naked men, he took pity and made them get into the wagon. There they
found hay to lie on and empty sacks to cover themselves with. Being
warm, they gave thanks to God. Ulenspiegel, riding by the side of the
wagon on one of the reiters&rsquo; horses, held the other by the
bridle.</p>
<p>At M&eacute;zi&egrave;res they alighted: there they were given good
soup, beer, bread, cheese, and meat, the old men and the women. They
were lodged, clad, and weaponed afresh at the charge of the commune.
And they all gave the embrace of blessing to Ulenspiegel, who received
it rejoicing.</p>
<p>He sold the horses of the two reiters for forty-eight florins, of
which he gave thirty to the Frenchmen.</p>
<p>Going on his way alone, he said to himself: &ldquo;I go through
ruins, blood, and tears, without finding aught. The devils lied to me,
past a doubt. Where is Lamme? Where is Nele? Where are the
Seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he heard a voice like a low breath, saying: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In death, ruin, and tears, seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went his way.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ulenspiegel came to Namur in March. There he saw
Lamme, who having been seized with a great love for the fish of the
River Meuse, and especially for the trout, had hired a boat and was
fishing in the river by leave of the commune. But he had paid fifty
florins to the guild of the fishmongers.</p>
<p>He sold and ate his fish, and in this trade he gained a better
paunch and a little bag of carolus.</p>
<p>Seeing his friend and comrade going along the banks of the Meuse to
come into the town, he was filled with joy, thrust his boat up against
the bank, and climbing up the steep, not without puffing, he came to
Ulenspiegel. Stammering with pleasure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are then, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my son in
God, for my belly-ark could carry two like you. Whither go you? What
would you? You are not dead, without a doubt? Have you seen my wife?
You shall eat Meuse fish, the best that is in this world below; they
make sauces in this country fit to make you eat your fingers up to the
shoulder. You are proud and splendid, with the bronze of battle on your
cheeks. There you are then, my son, my friend Ulenspiegel, the jolly
vagabond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many Spaniards have you killed? You never saw my wife in
their wagons full of wenches? And the Meuse wine, so delicious for
constipated folk, you shall drink of it. Are you wounded, my son? You
will stay here then, fresh, lively, keen as an eagle. And the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>eels, you shall taste lad. No marshy flavour
whatever. Kiss me, my fat lad. My blessing upon God, how glad I
am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme danced, leapt, puffed, and forced Ulenspiegel to dance as
well.</p>
<p>Then they wended their way towards Namur. At the gate of the city
Ulenspiegel showed his pass signed by the duke. And Lamme brought him
to his house.</p>
<p>While he was making their meal ready, he made Ulenspiegel tell his
adventures and recounted his own, having, he said, abandoned the army
to follow after a girl that he thought was his wife. In this pursuit he
had come as far as Namur. And he kept repeating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not seen her at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw others that were very beautiful,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and especially in this town, where all are
amorous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;a hundred times they
would fain have had me, but I remained faithful, for my sad heart is
big with a single memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As your belly is big with innumerable dishes,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Lamme replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am in distress I must eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your grief without respite?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes!&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>And pulling a trout from out a saucepan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how lovely and firm it is. This
flesh is pink as my wife&rsquo;s. To-morrow we shall leave Namur; I
have a pouch full of florins; we shall buy an ass apiece, and we shall
depart riding thus towards the land of Flanders.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You will lose heavily by it,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart draws me to Damme, which was the place where she
loved me well: perchance she has returned thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall start to-morrow,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;since you wish it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, they set out, each mounted on an ass and
straddling along side by side.</p>

<p class="first">A sharp wind was blowing. The sun, bright as youth in
the morning, was veiled and gray as an old man. A rain mixed with hail
was falling.</p>
<p>The rain having ceased, Ulenspiegel shook himself, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sky that drinks up so much mist must relieve itself
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another rain, still more mingled with hail than the former, beat
down on the two companions. Lamme groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were well washed, now we must needs be rinsed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun reappeared, and they rode on gaily.</p>
<p>A third rain fell, so full of hail and so deadly that like knives it
chopped the dry twigs on the trees to mincemeat.</p>
<p>Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! a roof! My poor wife! Where are ye, good fire, soft
kisses, and fat soups?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he wept, the great fellow.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We bemoan ourselves,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is it not from
ourselves none the less that our woes come on us? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>It is
raining on our backs, but this December rain will make the clover of
May. And the kine will low for pleasure. We are without a shelter, but
why did we never marry? I mean myself, with little Nele, so pretty and
so kind, who would now give me a good stew of beef and beans to eat. We
are thirsty in spite of the water that is falling; why did we not make
ourselves workmen steady in one condition? Those who are received as
masters in their trade have in their cellars full casks of <i lang=
"nl">bruinbier</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ashes of Claes beat upon his heart, the sky became clear, the
sun shone out in it, and Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Sun, thanks be unto you, you warm our loins again;
ashes of Claes, ye warm our heart once more, and tell us that blessed
are they that are wanderers for the sake of the deliverance of the land
of our fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They came into an inn, where they were served with
supper in an upper chamber. Ulenspiegel, opening the windows, saw from
thence a garden in which a comely girl was walking, plump, round
bosomed, with golden hair, and clad only in a petticoat, a jacket of
white linen, and an apron of black stuff, full of holes.</p>
<p>Chemises and other woman&rsquo;s linen was bleaching on cords: the
girl, still turned towards Ulenspiegel, was taking chemises down from
the lines, and putting them back and smiling and still looking at him,
and sat down on linen bands, swinging on the two ends knotted together.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>Near by Ulenspiegel heard a cock crowing and saw a nurse playing
with a child whose face she turned towards a man that was standing,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boelkin, look nicely at papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child wept.</p>
<p>And the pretty girl continued to walk about in the garden,
displacing and replacing the linen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a spy,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>The girl put her hands before her eyes, and smiling between her
fingers, looked at Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Then pressing up her two breasts with her hands, she let them fall
back, and swung again without her feet touching the ground. And the
linen, unwinding itself, made her turn like a top, while Ulenspiegel
saw her arms, bare to the shoulders, white and round in the pallid
sunshine. Turning and smiling, she kept always looking at him. He went
out to find her. Lamme followed him. At the hedge of the garden he
searched for an opening to pass through, but found none.</p>
<p>The girl, seeing what he was doing, looked again, smiling between
her fingers.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel tried to break through the hedge, while Lamme, holding
him back, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go there; she is a spy, we shall be burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl walked about the garden, covering up her face with her
apron, and looking through the holes to see if her chance friend would
not be coming soon.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was going to leap over the hedge with a running jump,
but he was prevented by Lamme, who caught hold of him by the leg and
made him fall, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rope, sword, and gallows, &rsquo;tis a spy, do not go
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting on the ground, Ulenspiegel struggled against <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>him. The
girl cried out, pushing up her head above the hedge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu, Messire, may Love keep your Longanimousness
hanging!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he heard a burst of mocking laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is in my ears like a packet of
pins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a door shut noisily.</p>
<p>And he was melancholy.</p>
<p>Lamme said to him, still holding him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are counting over the sweet treasures of beauty thus lost
to your shame. &rsquo;Tis a spy. You fall in luck when you fall. I am
going to burst with laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said not a word, and both got up on their asses once
more.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They went on their way each well astride his ass.</p>
<p>Lamme, chewing the cud of his last meat, sniffed up the cool air
rejoicing. Suddenly Ulenspiegel fetched him a great stinging slash of
his whip on his behind, which was like a cushion in the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried Lamme, piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This lash with the whip?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lash with the whip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one I got from you,&rdquo; returned Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the left?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, on the left and on my behind. Why did you do that,
scandalous vagabond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ignorance,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;I know well
enough what a whip is, and very well, too, what a behind of small
compass is upon a saddle. But seeing this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>one wide, swollen, tight,
and overflowing the saddle, I said to myself: &lsquo;Since it could
never be pinched with a finger, a stroke of the whip could not sting it
either with the lash.&rsquo; I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme smiling at this speech, Ulenspiegel went on in these
terms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not the only one in this world to sin through
ignorance, and there is more than one past-master idiot displaying his
fat on a donkey saddle who could give me points. If my whip sinned on
your behind, you sinned much more weightily on my legs in preventing
them from running after the girl who was coquetting in her
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crow&rsquo;s meat!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;so it was
revenge then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little one,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>

<p class="first">At Damme Nele the unhappy lived alone with Katheline
who still for love called the cold devil who never came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;thou art rich, Hanske my
darling, and mightest bring me back the seven hundred carolus. Then
would Soetkin come back alive from limbo to this earth, and Claes would
laugh in the sky: well canst thou do this. Take away the fire, the soul
would fain come out; make a hole, the soul would fain come
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without ceasing she pointed her finger to the place where the
tow had been.</p>
<p>Katheline was very poor, but the neighbours helped her with beans,
with bread and meat according to their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

her some money. And Nele sewed dresses for rich women in the town; went
to their houses to iron their linen, and in this way earned a florin a
week.</p>
<p>And Katheline still repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a hole; take away my soul. It knocks to get out. He will
give back the seven hundred carolus.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Meanwhile, Ulenspiegel and Lamme, armed with their
passes, came to a little inn backed up against the rocks of the Sambre,
which in certain places are covered with trees. And on the sign there
was written: <i>Chez Marlaire</i>.</p>
<p>Having drunk many a flask of Meuse wine of the fashion of Burgundy
and eaten much fish, they gossiped with the host, a Papist of the
deepest dye, but as talkative as a magpie through the wine he had drunk
and all the time winking an eye cunningly. Ulenspiegel, divining some
mystery under this winking, made him drink more, so much that the host
began to dance and burst out into laughter, then returning to the
table:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Catholics,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I drink to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you we drink,&rdquo; replied Lamme and Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the extinction of all plague, of rebellion and
heresy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We drink,&rdquo; replied Lamme and Ulenspiegel, who kept
replenishing the goblet the host could never allow to stay full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are good fellows,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I drink to your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>Generosities; I make a profit on wine drunk. Where
are your passes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signed by the duke,&rdquo; said the host. &ldquo;I drink to
the duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the duke we drink,&rdquo; replied Lamme and Ulenspiegel.
The host, continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we catch rats, mice, and field mice? In rat-traps,
snares, and mouse-traps. Who is the field mouse? &rsquo;Tis the great
heretic Orange as hellfire. God is with us. They are coming. H&eacute;!
h&eacute;! Something to drink! Pour out, I am roasting, burning. To
drink! Most goodly little reforming preachers.... I say little ...
goodly little gallants, stout troopers, oak trees.... Drink! Will you
not go with them to the great heretic&rsquo;s camp? I have passes
signed by him. Ye shall see their work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go to the camp,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will get there all right, and by night if an opportunity
offers&rdquo; (and the host, whistling, made the gesture of a man
cutting a throat). &ldquo;Steel-wind will stop the blackbird Nassau
from ever whistling again. Come on, something to drink, hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a gay fellow, even though you are married,&rdquo;
replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Said the host:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither was nor am. I hold the secrets of princes. Drink
up! My wife would steal them from my pillow to have me hanged and to be
a widow sooner than Nature means it. Vive Dieu! they are coming ...
where are the new passes? On my Christian heart. Let us drink! They are
there, three hundred paces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>along the road, at Marche-les-Dames.
Do ye see them? Let us drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;I drink to the king,
to the duke, to the preachers, to Steel-wind; I drink to you, to me; I
drink to the wine and to the bottle. You are not drinking.&rdquo; And
at every health Ulenspiegel filled up his glass and the host emptied
it.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel studied him for some time; then rising up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is asleep,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let us go,
Lamme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were outside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no wife to betray us.... The night is about to come
down.... You heard clearly what this rogue said, and you know who the
three preachers are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know they are coming from Marche-les-Dames, along by the
Meuse, and it will be well to wait for them on the way before
Steel-wind blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must save the prince&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;take my musket; go
there into the underwoods between the rocks; load it with two bullets
and fire when I croak like a crow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>And he disappeared into the undergrowth. And Ulenspiegel soon heard
the creak of the lock of the musket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see them coming?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see them,&rdquo; replied Lamme. &ldquo;They are three,
marching like soldiers, and one of them overtops the others by the
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel sat down on the road, his legs out in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>front of
him, murmuring prayers on a rosary, as beggars do. And he had his
bonnet between his knees.</p>
<p>When the three preachers passed by, he held out his bonnet to them,
but they put nothing in.</p>
<p>Then rising, Ulenspiegel said piteously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good sirs, refuse not a patard to a poor workman, a porter
who lately cracked his loins falling into a mine. They are hard folk in
this country, and they would give me nothing to relieve my wretched
plight. Alas! give me a patard, and I will pray for you. And God will
keep Your Magnanimities in joy throughout all their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said one of the preachers, a fine robust
fellow, &ldquo;there will be no joy more for us in this world so long
as the Pope and the Inquisition reign therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel sighed also, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! what are you saying, my masters! Speak low, if it
please Your Graces. But give me a patard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; replied a preacher who had a warrior-like
face, &ldquo;we others, poor martyrs, we have no patards beyond what we
need to sustain life on our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel threw himself on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The three preachers stretched out their hands over
Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s head with no devoutness.</p>
<p>Remarking that they were lean men, and yet had fine paunches, he got
up again, pretended to fall, and striking his forehead against the tall
preacher&rsquo;s belly, he heard therein a gay clink and tinkle of
money.</p>
<p>Then drawing himself up and drawing his bragmart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodly fathers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is chilly
weather and I am lightly clad; you are clad overly much. Give me your
wool that I may cut myself a cloak out of it. I am a Beggar. Long live
the Beggars!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>The tall preacher replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Beggar-cock, you carry your comb too high; we shall cut it
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, drawing back, &ldquo;but
Steel-wind shall blow for you before ever it blows for the prince.
Beggar I am; long live the Beggars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three preachers, <span class="corr" id="xd20e1663" title=
"Source: dumfounded">dumbfounded</span>, said one to another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence does he know this news? We are betrayed! Slay! Long
live the Mass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they drew from under their hose fine bragmarts, well
sharpened.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel, without waiting for them, gave ground towards that
side of the brushwood where Lamme was hidden. Judging that the
preachers were within musket range, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows, black crows, Lead-wind is about to blow. I sing for
your finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he croaked.</p>
<p>A musket shot, from out of the brushwood, knocked over the tallest
of the preachers with his face to the ground, and was followed by a
second shot which stretched the second on the road.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel saw amid the brush Lamme&rsquo;s good visage, and
his arm up hastily recharging his arquebus.</p>
<p>And a blue smoke rose up above the black brushwood.</p>
<p>The third preacher, furious with rage, would fain by main force have
cut down Ulenspiegel, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steel-wind or Lead-wind, thou art about to go over from this
world to the other, foul artificer of murders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he attacked him, and he defended himself bravely. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>And they both remained standing face to face stiffly upon the
highway, delivering and parrying blows. Ulenspiegel was all bloody, for
his opponent, a tough soldier, had wounded him in the head and the leg.
But he attacked and defended like a lion. As the blood that flowed from
his head blinded him, he broke ground continually with great strides,
wiped it off with his left hand and felt himself grow weak. He was like
to be killed had not Lamme fired on the preacher and brought him
down.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel saw and heard him belch forth blasphemy, blood, and
deathfoam.</p>
<p>And the blue smoke rose up above the black brushwood, amidst of
which Lamme showed his good face once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all over?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, my son,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;But
come....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme, coming out of his niche, saw Ulenspiegel all covered with
blood. Then running like a stag, in spite of his belly, he came to
Ulenspiegel, seated on the earth beside the slain men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is wounded,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my friend, wounded by
that murdering rascal.&rdquo; And with a kick from his heel he broke in
the teeth of the nearest preacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not answer, Ulenspiegel! Are you going to die, my son?
Where is that balsam? Ha! in the bottom of his satchel, under the
sausages. Ulenspiegel, do you not hear me? Alas! I have no warm water
to wash your wound, nor any way to have it. But the water of the Sambre
will serve. Speak to me, my friend. You are not so terribly wounded, in
any case. A little water, there, very cold water, is it not? He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>awakes. &rsquo;Tis I, thy friend: they are all
dead! Linen! linen to tie up his hurts. There is none. My shirt
then.&rdquo; He took off his doublet. And Lamme continuing his
discourse: &ldquo;In pieces, shirt! The blood is stopping. My friend
will not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how cold it is, bareback in this
keen air. Let us reclothe ourselves. He will not die. &rsquo;Tis I,
Ulenspiegel, I thy friend Lamme. He smiles. I shall despoil the
assassins. They have bellies of florins. Gilded entrails, carolus,
florins, daelders, patards, and letters! We are rich. More than three
hundred carolus to share. Let us take the arms and the money.
Steel-wind will not blow as yet for Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, his teeth chattering from the cold, rose up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are on your feet,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the might of the balsam,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The balsam of valiancy,&rdquo; answered Lamme.</p>
<p>Then taking the bodies of the three preachers one by one, he cast
them into a hole among the rocks, leaving them their weapons and their
clothes, all save their cloaks.</p>
<p>And all about them in the sky croaked the ravens, awaiting their
food.</p>
<p>And the Sambre rolled along like a river of steel under the gray
sky.</p>
<p>And the snow fell, washing the blood away.</p>
<p>And they were nevertheless troubled. And Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather kill a chicken than a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they mounted their asses again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the gates of Huy the blood was still flowing; they pretended to
fall into quarrel together, got down from their asses, and fenced and
foined with their daggers most cruelly to behold; then having brought
the combat to an end, they mounted again and entered into Huy, showing
their passes at the gates of the city.</p>
<p>The women seeing Ulenspiegel wounded and bleeding, and Lamme playing
the victor upon his ass, they looked on Ulenspiegel with pity and
showed their fists at Lamme saying: &ldquo;That one is the rascal that
wounded his friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme, uneasy, only sought among them whether he did not see his
wife.</p>
<p>It was in vain, and he was plunged in melancholy.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Whither are we going?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Maestricht,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my son, they say the duke&rsquo;s army is there all
about and around, and that he himself is within the city. Our passes
will not be enough for us. If the Spanish troopers accept them, none
the less we shall be held in the town and interrogated. Meanwhile, they
will have discovered the death of the preachers, and we shall have
finished with living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ravens, the owls, and the vultures will soon have made an
end of their meat; already, beyond a doubt, they have faces that could
not be recognized. As for our passes they may be good; but if they
learned of the slaughter, we should, as you say, be taken prisoners.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>Nevertheless, we must needs go to Maestricht and
take Landen on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will hang us,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall pass,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Thus talking, they arrived at the <i>Magpie</i> inn, where they
found good meals, good beds, and hay for their asses.</p>
<p>The next day they set out on their way to Landen.</p>
<p>Having arrived at a great farm near the city, Ulenspiegel whistled
like the lark, and immediately there answered from within the warlike
clarion of a cock. A farmer with a goodly face appeared on the
threshold of the farmhouse. He said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, as freemen, long live the Beggar! Come
within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this one?&rdquo; asked Lamme.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Utenhove, the brave reformer; his serving men and
women on the farm work like him for freedom of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Utenhove said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are the prince&rsquo;s envoys. Eat and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the ham began to crackle in the pan and the black puddings also,
and the wine went about and glasses were filled. And Lamme fell to
drinking like the dry sand and to eating lustily.</p>
<p>Lads and lasses of the farm came in turns and thrust in their noses
at the half-open door to look at him labouring with his jaws. And the
men, jealous of him, said they could do as well as he.</p>
<p>At the end of the meal Thomas Utenhove said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred peasants will go from here this week under pretence
of going to work on the dykes at Bruges <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>and round about. They
will travel by bands of five or six and by different ways. There will
be boats at Bruges to fetch them by sea to Emden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they be furnished with weapons and money?&rdquo; asked
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will have each ten florins and big cutlasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God and the prince will reward you,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not working for reward,&rdquo; replied Thomas
Utenhove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do,&rdquo; said Lamme, eating big black puddings,
&ldquo;what do you do, master host, to have a dish so savoury, so
succulent, and with such fine grease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis because we put in it,&rdquo; the host said,
&ldquo;cinnamon and catnip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then speaking to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Edzard, Count of Frisia, is he still the prince&rsquo;s
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hides it, while at the same time giving refuge at Emden to
his ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go to Maestricht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not be able to do so,&rdquo; said the host;
&ldquo;the duke&rsquo;s army is before the town and in the
environs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then taking him into the loft, he showed him far away the ensigns
and guidons of horse soldiers and footmen riding and marching in the
country.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall make my way through if you, who are of authority in
this place, will give me a permit to marry. As for the woman, she must
be pretty, gentle, and sweet, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>and willing to marry me, if not for
always, at least for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme sighed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not do this, my son; she will leave you alone, burning in
the fires of love. Your bed, where you now sleep so snugly, will become
as a mattress of holly to you, depriving you of sweet
slumber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take a wife,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And Lamme, finding nothing more on the table, was deeply distressed.
However, having discovered castrelins in a bowl, he ate them in
melancholy fashion.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said to Thomas Utenhove:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then, let us drink; give me a wife rich or poor. I
shall go with her to church and have the marriage blessed by the
cur&eacute;. And he will give us the certificate of marriage, which
will not be valid since it comes from a Papist and inquisitor; we shall
have it set down in it that we are all good Christians, having
confessed and taken the Sacrament, living apostolically according to
the precepts of our Holy Mother the Roman Church, which burneth her
children, and thus calling upon us the blessings of our Holy Father the
Pope, the armies celestial and terrestrial, the saints both men and
women, deans, cur&eacute;s, monks, soldiers, catchpolls, and other
rascals. Armed with this certificate aforesaid, we shall make our
preparations for the usual festal wedding journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the woman,&rdquo; said Thomas Utenhove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find her for me,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;I will take two wagons, then; I will bedeck them with wreaths
adorned with pine boughs, holly, and paper flowers; I will fill them
with certain of the lads you want to send to the prince.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But the woman?&rdquo; said Thomas Utenhove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is here without a doubt,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel. And
continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall harness two of your horses to one of the wagons, our
two asses to the other. In the first wagon I shall put my wife and
myself, my friend Lamme, the witnesses of the marriage; in the second,
tambourine players, fifers, and shawm players. Then displaying the
joyful marriage flags, playing the tambourine, singing, drinking, we
will go trotting down the highway that leads to the Galgen-Veld, the
Gallows Field, or to liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will help you,&rdquo; said Thomas Utenhove. &ldquo;But the
women and girls will wish to go with their men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go, by the grace of God,&rdquo; said a pretty girl,
putting her head in at the half-open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be four wagons, if they are needed,&rdquo; said
Thomas Utenhove; &ldquo;in this way we shall get more than twenty-five
men through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke will be crestfallen,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the prince&rsquo;s fleet served by some good soldiers the
more,&rdquo; replied Thomas Utenhove.</p>
<p>Having his serving men and women summoned then by ringing a bell, he
said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ye that are of Zealand, men and women, oyez; Ulenspiegel
the Fleming here present desires that you should pass through the
duke&rsquo;s army in wedding array.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men and women of Zealand shouted together:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger of death! we are willing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the men said, one to another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is joy to us to leave the land of slavery to go to the
free sea. If God be for us, who shall be against us?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>Women and girls said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us follow our husbands and our lovers. We are of Zealand
and we shall find harbour there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel espied a pretty young girl, and said to her,
jesting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she, blushing, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing, but only in church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women, laughing, said to one another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her heart turns to Hans Utenhove, the son of the <i lang=
"nl">baes</i>. Doubtless he is going with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; replied Hans.</p>
<p>And the father said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men donned festal raiment, doublet and breeches of velvet, and
the big <i lang="nl">opperst-kleed</i> over all, and large kerchiefs on
their heads, to keep off sun and rain; the women in black stockings and
pinked shoes; wearing the big gilt jewel on their foreheads, on the
left for the girls, on the right for the married women; the white ruff
upon their necks, the plastron of gold, scarlet, and azure embroidery,
the petticoat of black woollen, with wide velvet stripes of the same
colour, black woollen stockings and velvet shoes with silver
buckles.</p>
<p>Then Thomas Utenhove went off to the church to beg the priest to
marry immediately, for two <i lang="nl">ryck-daelders</i> which he put
in his hand, Thylbert the son of Claes, which was Ulenspiegel, and
Tannekin Pieters, to the which the cur&eacute; consented.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then went to church followed by the whole wedding party,
and there he married before the priest Tannekin, so pretty and sweet,
so gracious and so plump, that he would gladly have bitten her cheeks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>like a love-apple. And he told her so, not daring
to do it for the respect he had to her gentle beauty. But she, pouting,
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone: there is Hans looking murder at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a jealous girl said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look elsewhere: do you not see she is afraid of her
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme, rubbing his hands, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to have them all, rogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was delighted.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, applying patience to his trouble, came back to the farm
with the wedding party. And there he drank, sang, and was jolly,
drinking hob-nob with the jealous girl. Thereat Hans was merry, but not
Tannekin, nor the girl&rsquo;s betrothed.</p>
<p>At noon, in bright sunshine and a cool wind, the wagons set forth,
all greenery and flowers, all the banners displayed to the merry sound
of tambourines, shawms, fifes, and bagpipes.</p>
<p>At Alba&rsquo;s camp there was another feast. The advanced outposts
and sentinels having sounded the alarm, came in one after another,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enemy is near at hand; we have heard the noise of
tambourines and fifes and seen his ensigns. It is a strong body of
cavalry come there to draw you into some ambush. The main army is
doubtless farther on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke at once had his camp masters, colonels, and captains
informed, ordered them to set the army in battle array, and sent to
reconnoitre the enemy.</p>
<p>Suddenly there appeared four wagons advancing towards the
musketeers. In the wagons men and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>women were dancing, bottles were
jigging round, and merrily squealed the fifes, moaned the shawms, beat
the drums and droned the bagpipes.</p>
<p>The wedding party having halted, Alba came in person to the noise,
and beheld the new-made bride on one of the four wagons; Ulenspiegel,
her bridegroom, all rosy and fine beside her, and all the country folk,
both men and women, alighted on the ground, dancing all about and
offering drink to the soldiers.</p>
<p>Alba and his train marvelled greatly at the simplicity of these
peasants who were singing and feasting when everything was in arms all
about them.</p>
<p>And those who were in the wagons gave all their wine to the
soldiers.</p>
<p>And they were well applauded and welcomed by them.</p>
<p>The wine giving out in the wagons, the peasants went on their way
again to the sound of the tambourines, fifes, and bagpipes, without
being interfered with.</p>
<p>And the soldiers, gay and jolly, fired a salvo of musket shots in
their honour.</p>
<p>And thus they came into Maestricht, where Ulenspiegel made
arrangements with the reformers&rsquo; agents to despatch by vessels
arms and munitions to the fleet of the Silent.</p>
<p>And they did the same at Landen.</p>
<p>And they went in this way elsewhere, clad as workmen.</p>
<p>The duke heard of the trick; and there was a song made upon it,
which was sent him, and the refrain of which was:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Bloody Duke, silly head,</p>
<p class="line">Have you seen the newlywed?</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=

<p>And every time he had made a wrong man&oelig;uvre the soldiers would
sing:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Duke has dust in eye:</p>
<p class="line">He has seen the newlywed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the meantime, King Philip was plunged in bitter
melancholy. In his grievous pride he prayed to God to give him power to
conquer England, to subdue France, to take Milan, Genoa, Venice, and
great lord of all the seas, thus to reign over all Europe.</p>
<p>Thinking of this triumph, he laughed not.</p>
<p>He was continually and always cold; wine never warmed him, nor the
fire of scented wood that was always burning in the chamber where he
was. There always writing, sitting amid so many letters that a hundred
casks might have been filled with them, he brooded over the universal
domination of the whole world, such as was wielded by the emperors of
Rome; on his jealous hatred of his son Don Carlos, since the latter had
wanted to go to the Low Countries in the Duke of Alba&rsquo;s place, to
seek to reign there, he thought, without doubt. And seeing him ugly,
deformed, a savage and cruel madman, he hated him the more. But he
never spoke of it.</p>
<p>Those who served King Philip and his son Don Carlos knew not which
of the twain they ought to fear the most; whether the son, agile,
murderous, tearing his servitors with his nails, or the cowardly and
crafty father, using others to strike, and like a hy&aelig;na, living
upon corpses.</p>
<p>The servitors were terrified to see them prowling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>around
each other. And they said that there would soon be a death in the
Escurial.</p>
<p>Now they learned presently that Don Carlos had been imprisoned for
the crime of high treason. And they knew that he was devouring his soul
with black spite, that he had hurt his face trying to get through the
bars of his prison in order to escape, and that Madame Isabelle of
France, his mother, was weeping without ceasing.</p>
<p>But King Philip was not weeping.</p>
<p>The rumour came to them that Don Carlos had been given green figs
and that he was dead the next day as if he had gone to sleep. The
physicians said as soon as he had eaten the figs the blood ceased to
beat, the functions of life, as Nature meant them, were interrupted; he
could neither spit, nor vomit, nor get rid of anything from out of his
body. His belly swelled at his death.</p>
<p>King Philip heard the death mass for Don Carlos, had him buried in
the chapel of his royal residence and marble set over his body; but he
did not weep.</p>
<p>And the lords in waiting said to one another, mocking the princely
epitaph that was on the tombstone:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd20e2005">
<p class="line">HERE LIES ONE WHO, EATING GREEN FIGS,</p>
<p class="line">DIED WITHOUT HAVING BEEN SICK</p>
</div>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter xd20e2010">
<p class="line">A qui jaze qui en para desit verdad,</p>
<p class="line">Morio s&rsquo;in infirmidad</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And King Philip looked with a lustful eye upon the
Princess of Eboli, who was married. He besought her love, and she
yielded.</p>
<p>Madame Isabelle of France, of whom it was said that she had favoured
the designs of Don Carlos upon the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"
href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>Low Countries, became haggard
and woebegone. And her hair fell out in great handfuls at a time. Often
she vomited, and the nails of her feet and her hands came out. And she
died.</p>
<p>And King Philip did not weep.</p>
<p>The hair of the Prince of Eboli fell out also. He became sad and
always complaining. Then the nails of his feet and his hands came out,
too.</p>
<p>And King Philip had him buried.</p>
<p>And he paid for the widow&rsquo;s mourning and did not weep.</p>

<p class="first">At this time certain women and girls of Damme came to
ask Nele if she would be the May bride and hide among the brushwood
with the groom that would be found for her; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said the
women, not without jealousy, &ldquo;there is not one young man in all
Damme and round about who would not fain be betrothed to you, who stay
so lovely, good, and fresh: the gift of a witch, doubtless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodwives,&rdquo; answered Nele, &ldquo;say to the young men
that seek after me: &lsquo;Nele&rsquo;s heart is not here, but with him
that wandereth to deliver the land of our fathers.&rsquo; And if I am
fresh, even as you say, it is no gift of a witch, but the gift of good
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goodwives replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, Katheline is suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not believe what ill folk say,&rdquo; answered Nele;
&ldquo;Katheline is no witch. The law-men burned tow upon her head and
God struck her with witlessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katheline, nodding her head in a corner where she was sitting
all huddled up, said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Take away the fire; he will come back, my darling
Hanske.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goodwives asking who was this Hanske, Nele replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the son of Claes, my foster brother, whom she thinks
she lost since God struck her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the kindly goodwives gave silver patards to Katheline. And when
they were new she showed them to someone that nobody could see,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rich, rich in shining silver. Come, Hanske, my darling;
I will pay for my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the goodwives being gone, Nele wept in the lonely cottage. And
she thought on Ulenspiegel wandering in far-off countries where she
might not follow him, and on Katheline who, often groaning &ldquo;take
away the fire,&rdquo; held her bosom with both hands, showing in this
way that the fire of madness burned her head and her body
feverishly.</p>
<p>And in the meanwhile the bride and groom of May hid in the
grass.</p>
<p>He or she who found one of them was, according to the sex of the one
found, and his or her own, King or Queen of the feast.</p>
<p>Nele heard the cries of joy of the lads and lasses when the May
bride was found on the edge of a ditch, hidden among the tall
grasses.</p>
<p>And she wept, thinking on the sweet time when they hunted for her
and her friend Ulenspiegel.</p>

<p class="first">Meanwhile, Lamme and he were riding along well
astraddle upon their asses. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen here, Lamme,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;the
nobles of the Low Countries, through jealousy against Orange, have
betrayed the cause of the confederates, the holy alliance, the valiant
covenant signed for the good of the land of our fathers. Egmont and de
Hoorn were traitors alike and with no advantage to themselves.
Brederode is dead; in this war there is nothing left us now but the
poor common folk of Brabant and Flanders waiting for loyal chiefs to go
forward; and then, my son, the isles, the isles of Zealand, North
Holland, too, over which the Prince is governor; and farther still and
on the sea, Edzard, Count of Emden and East Frisia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I see it clear; we journey
between rope, rack, and stake, dying of hunger, gaping for thirst, and
with no hope of rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are but at the beginning,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;Deign to consider how that all in this is pleasure for us,
slaying our enemies, mocking them, having our pouches full of florins;
well laden with meat, with beer, with wine, with brandy. What would you
have more, feather bed? Would you like us to sell our asses and buy
horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;the trotting of a horse is
very severe on a man of my corpulence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sit on your steed as peasants do,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and no man will mock at you, since you are clad
like a peasant, and do not wear the sword like me, but only carry a
pikestaff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;are you sure that our two
passes will avail for the little towns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have not I the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s certificate,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;with the great seal of the Church in red wax
hanging from it by two tails of parchment, and our confession
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>cards? The soldiers and catchpolls of the duke
have no power against two men so well armed. And the black paternosters
we have for sale? We are two reiters, both of us, you a Fleming and I a
German, travelling by express command from the duke, to win over the
heretics of this land to the Holy Catholic faith by the sale of sacred
articles. We shall thus enter everywhere the houses of noble lords and
the fat abb&eacute;s. And they will give us rich hospitality. And we
shall surprise their secrets. Lick your chops, my gentle
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;we will then be carrying on
the trade of spies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By law and right of war,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they hear of the affair of the three preachers, we shall
die without a doubt,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My standards &lsquo;Live&rsquo; as motto
bear</p>
<p class="line">Live ever in a sunshine land</p>
<p class="line">My skin the first is buff well tanned</p>
<p class="line">And steel the second skin I wear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But Lamme, sighing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing but one skin, and a soft one; the least stroke
of a dagger would make a hole in it immediately. We should do better to
settle in some useful trade than to gad about in this way over hill and
valley, to serve all these great princes who, with their feet in velvet
hose, eat ortolans on gilded tables. To us the blows, perils, battle,
rain, hail, snow, the thin soups that fall to vagabonds. To them the
fine sausages, fat capons, savoury thrushes, succulent
fowls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is coming into your mouth, my gentle friend,&rdquo;
said Ulenspiegel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are ye, fresh bread, golden <i>koekebakken</i>,
delicious creams? But where art thou, my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart and drive me on to the battle.
But thou, mild lamb that hast naught to avenge, neither the death of
thy father nor of thy mother, nor the grief of those thou lovest, nor
thy present poverty, leave me alone to march whither I say, if the
toils of war affright thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>And he pulled up his ass, which began to eat a tuft of thistles, of
which there was a great plantation on that wayside. Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s
ass stopped and ate likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;You will not leave me alone,
my son; that would be an infamous cruelty. To have lost my wife and
then further to lose my friend, that is impossible. I will whine no
more, I promise you. And since it must be&rdquo;&mdash;and he raised
his head proudly&mdash;&ldquo;I will go under the rain of bullets. Aye!
And in the midst of swords; aye! in the face of those foul soldiers
that drink blood like wolves. And if one day I fall at your feet bloody
and death-stricken, bury me; and if you see my wife, tell her that I
died because I could not bear to live without being loved by someone in
this world. No, I could not do it, my son Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme wept. And Ulenspiegel was moved to see that mild
courage.</p>

<p class="first">At this time the duke, dividing his army into two
corps, made the one march towards the Duchy of Luxembourg and the other
towards the Marquisate of Namur. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;is some military
decision unknown to me; it is all one to me, let us go towards
Maestricht boldly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went alongside the Meuse near the city Lamme saw Ulenspiegel
looking attentively at all the boats that were moving in the river; and
he stopped before one of them that bore a siren on the prow. And this
siren held a scutcheon on which there was marked in gold letters on a
sable ground the sign J. H. S., which is that of Our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel signed to Lamme to stop and began to sing merrily like a
lark.</p>
<p>A man came up on the boat, crowed like a cock, and then, on a sign
from Ulenspiegel, who brayed like a donkey and pointed him to the
people gathered on the quay, he began to bray terribly like a donkey.
Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s two asses laid back their ears and sang their
native song.</p>
<p>Women were passing; men, too, riding the towing horses, and
Ulenspiegel said to Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boatman is mocking us and our steeds. Suppose we go and
attack him on his boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him rather come hither,&rdquo; replied Lamme.</p>
<p>Then a woman spoke and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not want to come back with arms cut off, broken
backs, faces in bits, let that Stercke Pier bray in peace as he
pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hee haw! hee haw! hee haw!&rdquo; went the boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him sing,&rdquo; said the goodwife, &ldquo;we saw him the
other day lift up on his shoulders a cart laden with huge casks of
beer, and stop another cart pulled by a powerful horse. There,&rdquo;
she said, pointing to the inn of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span><i lang="nl"><span class=
"corr" id="xd20e2162" title=
"Source: Blauwe-Torren">Blauwe-Toren</span></i>, the Blue Tower,
&ldquo;he pierced with his knife, thrown from twenty paces off, an
oaken plank twelve inches thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hee haw! hee haw! hee haw!&rdquo; went the boatman, while a
lad of twelve years old got up on the bridge of the boat and started to
bray also.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much we care for your strong Peter! However Stercke Pier he
may be, we are more of it than he is, and there is my friend Lamme who
would eat two of his size without a hiccup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying, my son?&rdquo; asked Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;do not contradict
me through modesty. Aye, good people, goodwives and artisans, soon you
will behold him try the work of his arms and annihilate this famous
Stercke Pier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your might is well known,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;you could never hide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hee haw!&rdquo; went the boatman; &ldquo;hee haw!&rdquo; went
the lad.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ulenspiegel sang again, most melodiously like a lark. And
the men, the women, and the artisans, ravished with delight, asked him
where he had learned that divine whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In paradise, whence I have come direct,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Then, speaking to the man who never stopped braying and pointing
with his finger for mockery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stay there on your boat, rascal? Do you not dare
to come to land and mock at us and our steeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not dare?&rdquo; said Lamme. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hee haw! hee haw!&rdquo; went the boatman. &ldquo;Masters,
donkeys, playing the donkey, come up on my boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I do,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel in a low voice to
Lamme.</p>
<p>And speaking to the boatman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are the Stercke Pier, I, I am Thyl Ulenspiegel. And
these twain are our asses, Jef and Jan, who can bray better than you,
for it is their native tongue. As for going up on your rickety planks,
we have no mind to it. Your boat is like a tub; every time a wave
strikes it it goes back, and it can only move like the crabs,
sideways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, like the crabs!&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>Then the boatman, speaking to Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you muttering between your teeth, lump of
bacon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme, becoming furious, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evil Christian, who reproached me with my infirmity, know
that my bacon is my own and comes from my good food; while thou, old
rusty nail, thou livest but on old red herrings, candle wicks, skins of
stockfish, to judge from thy scrawny beef that can be seen sticking
through the holes in thy breeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be giving each other a stiff drubbing,&rdquo;
said the men, women, and artisans, delighted and full of curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hee haw! hee haw!&rdquo; went the boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not throw stones,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The boatman said a word in the ear of the lad hee-hawing beside him
on the boat, and with the help of a boat hook, which he handled
dexterously, came to the bank. When he was quite close, he said,
standing proudly upright: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>baes</i> asks if you dare to come on board his boat and
wage battle with him with fist and foot. These goodmen and goodwives
will be witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel with much dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We accept the combat,&rdquo; said Lamme with great
stateliness.</p>
<p>It was noon; the workmen, navvies, paviours, ship-makers, their
wives armed with their husbands&rsquo; luncheons, the children that
came to see their fathers refresh themselves with beans or boiled meat,
all laughed and clapped their hands at the idea of a battle at hand,
gaily hoping that one or the other of the combatants would have a
broken head or would fall into the river all in pieces for their
delectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme in a low voice, &ldquo;he will
throw us into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let yourself be thrown,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big man is afraid,&rdquo; said the crowd of workmen.</p>
<p>Lamme, still sitting on his ass, turned on them and looked
wrathfully at them, but they hooted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go on the boat,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;they will
see if I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words he was hooted again, and Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go on the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alighting from their asses, they threw the bridles to the boy who
patted the donkeys in friendly fashion, and led them where he saw
thistles growing.</p>
<p>Then Ulenspiegel took the boat hook, made Lamme get into the dinghy,
sculled along towards the boat, where by the help of a rope he climbed
up, preceded by Lamme, sweating and blowing hard.</p>
<p>When he was upon the bridge of the vessel<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e2253" title="Not in source">,</span> Ulenspiegel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>stooped
down as though he meant to lace up his boots, and said a few words to
the boatman, who smiled and looked at Lamme. Then he roared a thousand
insults at him, calling him rascal, stuffed with guilty fat, gaol seed,
<i lang="nl">pap-eter</i>, eater of pap, and saying: &ldquo;Big whale,
how many hogsheads of oil do you give when you are bled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once, without answering him, Lamme hurled himself on him like
a wild bull, flung him down, struck him with all his might, but did him
little harm because of the fat pithlessness of his arms. The boatman,
while pretending to struggle, let him do as he would, and Ulenspiegel
said: &ldquo;This rascal will pay for liquor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men, women, and workmen, who from the bank looked on at the
battle, said: &ldquo;Who would have imagined that this big man was so
impetuous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they clapped their hands while Lamme struck like a deaf man. But
the boatman took care for nothing except to save his face. Suddenly
Lamme was seen with his knee on Stercke Pier&rsquo;s breast, holding
him by the throat with one hand and raising the other to strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry for mercy,&rdquo; he said in fury, &ldquo;or I will drive
you through the ribs of your tub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman, coughing to show that he could not cry out, asked for
mercy with his hand.</p>
<p>Then Lamme was seen generously lifting up his enemy, who was soon on
his feet, and turning his back on the spectators, put out his tongue at
Ulenspiegel, who was bursting with laughter to see Lamme, proudly
shaking the feather in his cap, walking up and down the boat in mighty
triumph.</p>
<p>And the men, women, lads, and lasses, who were on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>bank,
applauded with all their might, saying: &ldquo;Hurrah for the conqueror
of Stercke Pier! He is a man of iron. Did ye see how he thumped him
with his fist and how he stretched him on his back with a blow from his
head? There they are, going to drink now to make peace. Stercke Pier is
coming up from the hold with wine and sausages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In very deed, Stercke Pier had come up with two tankards and a great
quart of white Meuse wine. And Lamme and he had made peace. And Lamme,
all gay and jolly because of his triumph, because of the wine and the
sausages, asked him, pointing to an iron chimney that was disgorging a
black thick smoke, what were the fricassees he was making in his
hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War cookery,&rdquo; replied Stercke Pier, smiling.</p>
<p>The crowd of artisans, women, and children being dispersed to go
back to their work or to their homes, the rumour ran speedily from
mouth to mouth that a great fat man, mounted on an ass and accompanied
by a little pilgrim, also mounted on an ass, was stronger than Samson
and that care must be taken not to offend him.</p>
<p>Lamme drank and looked at the boatman with a conquering air.</p>
<p>The other said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your donkeys are tired of being over yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, bringing the boat up against the quay, he got out on the
earth, took one of the asses by the hind legs and the forelegs, and
carrying him as Jesus carried the lamb, set it down on the bridge of
the boat. Then having done the same with the other one without so much
as drawing a quicker breath, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us drink.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>The lad leaped on the bridge.</p>
<p>And they drank. Lamme, all in a maze, no longer knew if it was
himself, native of Damme, who had beaten this strong man, and he no
longer dared to look at him, save by stealth, without any triumphing,
fearing that he might take a notion to lay hold of him as he had done
with the donkeys and throw him alive into the Meuse, for spite at his
overthrow.</p>
<p>But the boatman, smiling, invited him gaily to drink again, and
Lamme recovered from his fright and looked on him once more with
victorious assurance.</p>
<p>And the boatman and Ulenspiegel laughed.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the donkeys, dumbfounded to find themselves on a
floor that was not the <i>cows&rsquo; floor</i>, as the peasants call
dry land, had hung their heads, laid back their ears, and dared not
drink for fear. The boatman went off to fetch them one of the pecks of
corn he gave the horses that towed his boat, buying it himself so as
not to be cheated by the drivers in the price of fodder.</p>
<p>When the donkeys saw the grain they murmured paternosters of the jaw
while staring at the deck of the boat in melancholy fashion and not
daring to move a hoof for fear of slipping.</p>
<p>Thereupon the boatman said to Lamme and to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go into the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A war kitchen, but you may go down into it without fear, my
conqueror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am nowise afraid, and I follow you,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>The lad took the tiller.</p>
<p>Going down they saw everywhere bags of grain, of beans, peas,
carrots, and other vegetables. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85"
href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>The boatman then said to them, opening the door of a small
forge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since ye are men of valiant heart and know the cry of the
lark, the bird of the free, and the warrior clarion of the cock, and
the braying of the ass, the gentle worker, I am minded to show you my
war kitchen. This little forge you will find such an one in most Meuse
boats. No one can be suspicious of it, for it serves to mend and repair
the ironwork of the vessels; but what all do not possess is the goodly
vegetables contained in these cupboards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then removing some stones that covered the floor of the hold, he
raised a few planks, and pulled up a fine sheaf of musket barrels, and
lifting it as if it had been a feather, he put it back in its place;
then he showed them lance heads, halberds, sword blades; bags of
bullets, bags of powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;here are beans
and their sauce, the musket stocks are legs of mutton, the salads are
these halberd heads, and these musket barrels are ox shins for the soup
of freedom. Long live the Beggar! Where am I to take this
victual?&rdquo; he asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Nim&eacute;guen, where you will enter with your boat still
more heavily laden, with real vegetables, brought you by the peasants,
which you will take on board at Etsen, at Stephansweert, and at
Ruremonde. And they, too, will sing like the lark, the bird of the
free; you shall answer with the warlike clarion of the cock. You are to
go <span class="corr" id="xd20e2335" title="Not in source">to</span>
the house of Doctor Pontus, who lives beside the Nieuwe-Waal; you are
to tell him you are coming to the city with vegetables, but that you
fear the drought. While the peasants go to the market to sell the
vegetables <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>at a price too dear for any to buy, he will tell
you what you are to do with your weapons. I think, too, that he will
direct you to pass, not without danger, by the Wahal, the Meuse, or the
Rhine, exchanging vegetables for nets for sale, so that you may wander
with the Harlingen fishing boats, where there are many sailors that
know the lark&rsquo;s song; skirt the coast by the Waden, and get to
the Lauwer-Zee; exchange the nets for iron and lead; give costumes of
Marken, Vlieland, and Ameland to your peasants; remain awhile on the
coasts, fishing and salting down your fish to keep it and not to sell
it, for to drink cool and make war on salt is a lawful
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, let us drink,&rdquo; said the boatman.</p>
<p>And they went up on the deck.</p>
<p>But Lamme, falling into melancholy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master boatman,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;you have
here in your forge a little fire so bright that for certain one might
cook with it the most delicious of hotpots. My throat is thirsty for
soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will refresh you,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>And speedily he served him a rich soup, in which he had boiled a
thick slice of salt ham.</p>
<p>When Lamme had swallowed a few spoonfuls, he said to the
boatman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My throat is peeling, my tongue is burning: this is no
hotpot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cool drink and salt war&rsquo;, it was written,&rdquo;
replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Then the boatman filled up the tankards, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drink to the lark, the bird of freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drink to the cock, blowing the clarion of war.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drink to my wife; may she never be athirst, the poor
darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to go as far as Emden by the North Sea,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel to the boatman. &ldquo;Emden is a refuge for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea is wide,&rdquo; said the boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wide for the battle,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is with us,&rdquo; said the boatman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then shall be against us?&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you depart?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good voyage and a following wind. Here are powder and
bullets.&rdquo; And kissing them, he brought them ashore, after
carrying the two donkeys on his neck and shoulders like lambs.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Lamme having mounted them, they started for
Li&eacute;ge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, as they went on their way,
&ldquo;how did that man, so strong as he is, allow himself to be so
cruelly thumped by me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that everywhere we go,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;terror may precede you. That will be a better escort to us than
twenty landsknechts. Who would henceforth dare to attack Lamme the
mighty, the conqueror; Lamme the bull without peer, who with his head,
before the eyes and to the knowledge of everyone, overthrew the Stercke
Pier, Peter the Strong, who carries asses like lambs and lifts with one
shoulder a cart of beer barrels? Everyone knows you here already; you
are Lamme the terrible, Lamme the invincible, and I walk in the shadow
of your protection. Everyone will know <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>you along the way we are
to go, no one will dare to look on you with an unfriendly eye, and
considering the great valour of mankind, you will find nothing on your
path but louting, salutations, homage, and venerations offered to the
might of your redoubtable fist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak well, my son,&rdquo; said Lamme, drawing himself up
in his saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I speak the truth,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;Do
you see these curious faces in the first houses of this village? They
are pointing the finger, showing to one another Lamme, the terrific
conqueror. Do you see these men that look at you with envy and these
poor cowards that doff their kerchiefs! Reply to their salutation,
Lamme, my dear; disdain not the poor weak common herd. See the children
know your name and repeat it with awe and fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme passed by, proud and stately, saluting to the right and to
the left like a king. And the word of his prowess followed him from
burg to burg, from city to city, to Li&eacute;ge, Choquier, to
Neuville, Vesin, and Namur which they avoided because of the three
preachers.</p>
<p>They went on thus a long time, following up rivers, streams, and
canals. And everywhere to the lark&rsquo;s song answered the crowing of
the cock. And everywhere for the work of liberty men founded forges and
furbished the weapons that went away on the ships that skirted along
the coasts.</p>
<p>And they passed the tolls in casks, in cases, in baskets.</p>
<p>And there were found always good folk to receive them and to conceal
them in a sure place, with powder and bullets, until the hour of God.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Lamme wending his way with Ulenspiegel, still preceded by his
victorious reputation, began himself to believe in his great strength,
and becoming proud and bellicose, he let his hair grow long. And
Ulenspiegel christened him &ldquo;Lamme the Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lamme did not hold steadfast in the design because of the
irritation of the young growth on the fourth day. And he had the razor
passed over his conquering face, which appeared to Ulenspiegel once
more, round and full like a sun, lit up with the flame of good
victual.</p>
<p>In this wise they came to Stockem.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About nightfall, having left their asses at Stockem,
they entered into the city of Antwerp.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said to Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo this great city; here the whole world piles up its riches:
gold, silver, spices, gilded leather, Gobelin tapestry cloth, stuffs of
velvet, wool, and silk; beans, peas, grain, meat, and flour, salted
hides, Louvain wines, wines of Namur, of Luxembourg, Li&eacute;ge,
<i>Landtwyn</i> from Brussels and from Aerschot, Buley wines whose
vineyard is beside the Plante gate at Namur, Rhine wines, wines from
Spain and Portugal; grape oil from Aerschot that they call Landolium;
wines of Burgundy, Malvoisie and so many more. And the quays are
cumbered with merchandise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These riches of earth and of human toil bring into this place
the most beautiful light ladies that are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are growing dreamy,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel answered: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find the Seven among them. It was told me:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">In ruins, blood and tears, seek!</p>

<p class="first">What then is there that causeth more of ruin than
light wenches? Is it not in their company that poor witless men lose
their goodly carolus, shining and chinking; their jewels, chains, and
rings, and come away without a doublet, ragged and despoiled, even
without their linen; while the girls grow fat upon their spoils? Where
is the red clear blood that used to course in their veins? &rsquo;Tis
leek juice now. Or else, indeed, to enjoy their sweet and lovely bodies
do they not fight with knife, with dagger, with sword, without pity?
The corpses borne away, pale, and bloody, are corpses of the
love-distraught. When the father scolds and remains on his chair with
forbidding looks; when his white hairs seem whiter and stiffer; when
from his dry eyes, wherein burns the grief at a son&rsquo;s loss, the
tears refuse to flow; when the mother, silent and pale as a dead woman,
weeps as if she saw nothing before her now save all the sorrows that
this world holdeth, who is it makes those tears to fall? The gay ladies
that love but themselves and money, and hold the world, thinking or
working or philosophizing, fastened to the end of their golden girdle.
Aye, it is there the Seven are, and we shall go, Lamme, among the
girls. Perchance thy wife is among them; that will be a double sweep of
the net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>It was then in the month of June, towards the end of the summer,
when the sun was already reddening the leaves on the chestnuts, when
the little birds sing in the trees and there is never a mite so small
that he does not chirp for pleasure to be so warm in the grass.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lamme wandered beside Ulenspiegel through the streets of Antwerp,
hanging his head and dragging his body along like a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;you are plunged in
melancholy; do you not know that nothing is worse for the skin; if you
persist in your grief, you will lose it in strips. And it will be a
fine word to hear when they say of you: &lsquo;Lamme the
flayed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and eat,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And they went together to the Old Stairs, where they ate <i lang=
"nl">choesels</i> and drank <i lang="nl">dobbel-cuyt</i> as much as
they could carry.</p>
<p>And Lamme wept no more.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be the good beer that maketh thy soul all sunny!
Laughest and shakest thy big paunch. How I love to see thee dance of
the merry entrails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;they would dance far more
if I had the good luck to find my wife again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go and seek for her,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>They came thus to the quarter of the Lower Scheldt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel to Lamme, &ldquo;see that
little house all made of wood, with handsome windows, well opened and
glazed with little square panes; consider these yellow curtains and
that red lamp. There, my son, behind four casks of <i lang=
"nl">bruinbier</i>, of <i lang="nl">uitzet</i>, of <i lang=
"nl">dobbel-cuyt</i>, and Amboise wine, sits a beauteous <i>baesine</i>
of fifty years or upwards. Every year she lived gave her a fresh layer
of bacon. Upon one of the casks shines a candle, and there is a lantern
hung to the beams of the roof. It is bright and dark there, dark for
love, bright for payment.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;this is a convent of the
devil&rsquo;s nuns, and this <i lang="nl">baesine</i> is its
abbess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis she that
leadeth in Beelzebub&rsquo;s name, down the path of sin fifteen lovely
girls of amorous life, which find with her shelter and food, but it is
forbidden to them to sleep there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this convent?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to look for your wife therein. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I have taken thought and will
not go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou let thy friend expose himself all alone in the
midst of these Astartes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him not go there,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he must go in to find the Seven and your wife?&rdquo;
replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather sleep,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, opening the door and
thrusting Lamme in front of him. &ldquo;See, the <i>baesine</i> stays
behind her casks, between two candles; the chamber is large, with a
roof of blackened oak with smoked beams. All around reign benches,
lame-legged tables covered with glasses, quart pots, goblets, tankards,
jugs, flasks, bottles, and other implements of drinking. In the middle
are still more tables and chairs whereon are enthroned odds and ends,
the which are women&rsquo;s capes, gilded belts, velvet shoes,
bagpipes, fifes, shawms. In a corner is a ladder leading to the upper
story. A little bald hunchback plays on a clavecin mounted on glass
feet that make the sound of the instrument grating. Dance, my fat lad.
Fifteen lovely ladies are sitting, some on the tables, some on the
chairs, a leg here, a leg there, bending, upright, leaning on an elbow,
thrown back, lying on their back or on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>their side, at their
pleasure, clad in white, in red, their arms bare like their shoulders,
too, and their bosom down to the waist. There are some of every kind;
choose! For some the light of the candles, caressing their fair hair,
leaves in the shadow their blue eyes, of which nothing can be seen but
the gleaming of their liquid fire. Others, looking at the ceiling, sigh
to the viol some German ballade. Some round, brown, plump,
brazen-faced, are drinking from full tankards Amboise wine, and show
their round arms, bare to the shoulder, their half-opened dress, whence
come out the apples of their breasts, and shamelessly talk with their
mouths full, one after the other or all at once. Listen to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A straw for money to-day! it is love we must have, love at
our own choice,&rdquo; said the lovely ladies, &ldquo;child&rsquo;s
love, youth&rsquo;s love, whoever pleases us, and no
paying.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday was the day when one paid, to-day
is the day when one loves!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who so would fain drink at our
lips, they are still moist from the bottle. Wine and kisses, it is a
whole feast!&rdquo; &ldquo;A straw for widows that lie all
alone!&rdquo; &ldquo;We are girls! &rsquo;Tis the day of charity
to-day. To the young, the strong, and the comely, we will open our
arms. Something to drink!&rdquo; &ldquo;Darling, is it for the battle
of love that your heart is beating the tambourine in your breast! What
a pendulum! &rsquo;Tis the clock of kisses. When will they come, full
hearts and empty purses? Do they not scent out dainty adventures? What
is the difference between a young Beggar and Monsieur the Markgrave?
Monsieur pays in florins and the young Beggar in caresses. Long live
the Beggar! Who will go and wake up the graveyards?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus spake the good, the ardent, and the gay among the ladies of
amorous life.</p>
<p>But there were others of them with narrow faces, lean shoulders, who
made of their bodies a shop for savings, and liard by liard harvested
the price of their thin flesh. And these were fuming among themselves:
&ldquo;It is very foolish for us to refuse payment in this fatiguing
trade, for these ridiculous whimsies running in the heads of girls that
are wild over men. If they have a cantle of the moon in their heads, we
have none, and prefer not to have to drag around in our old age like
them, in rags in the gutter, but to be paid since we are for sale. A
straw for this gratis! Men are ugly, stinking, grumbling, greedy,
drunken. It is nothing but them that turns poor women to
ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young and beautiful ones did not hear these speeches, and
all in their pleasure and drinkings said: &ldquo;Do you hear the
passing bells ringing in Notre Dame? We are on fire! Who will go and
waken the graveyards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme seeing so many women all at once, brunette and fair, fresh and
withered, was ashamed; lowering his eyes he cried out:
&ldquo;Ulenspiegel, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead and gone, my friend,&rdquo; said a great stout
girl taking hold of his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead and gone?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;three hundred years ago, in the
company of Jacobus de Coster van Maerlandt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;and do not pinch me.
Ulenspiegel, where are you? Come and save your friend! I am going away
immediately if you do not let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not go away,&rdquo; they said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel,&rdquo; said Lamme, again, piteously,
&ldquo;where are you, my son? Madame, do not pull my hair in this way;
it is not a wig, I assure you. Help! Do you not think my ears red
enough, without your bringing the blood to them besides? There is that
other one filliping me all the time. You are hurting me! Alas! what are
they rubbing my face with now? A looking glass! I am black as the jaws
of an oven. I will be angry in a minute if you do not stop; it is ill
done of you to torment a poor man like this. Let me go! When you have
tugged me by my breeches to right, to left, from all sides, and have
made me go like a shuttle, will you be any the fatter for it? Aye, I
shall get angry without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will get angry,&rdquo; said they, mocking; &ldquo;he will
get angry, the good man. Laugh rather, and sing us a love
lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sing one of blows, if you wish, but let me
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you love here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody, neither you nor the others. I will complain to the
magistrates and he will have you whipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Whipped! And suppose we
were to kiss you by main force before this whipping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said they all.</p>
<p>And thereupon the lovely and the ugly, the fresh and the faded, the
brown and the fair all rushed upon Lamme, flung his bonnet into the
air, and his cloak, too, and fell to caressing him, kissing him on the
cheek, the nose, the back, with all their might.</p>
<p>The <i>baesine</i> laughed between her candles. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cried Lamme; &ldquo;help, Ulenspiegel; sweep
away all this rubbish. Let me go. I want none of your kisses; I am
married, God&rsquo;s blood! and keep all for my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;but your wife has over
much: a man of your corpulence. Give us a little. Faithful woman,
&rsquo;tis well and good; a faithful man, he is a capon. God keep you!
you must choose, or we shall whip you in our turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do no such thing,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have me?&rdquo; said a pretty, fair girl:
&ldquo;See, I am gentle, and I love whoever loves me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me alone,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have me?&rdquo; said a delicious girl, who had black
hair, eyes and complexion all brown, and in everything else made to
perfection by the angels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like gingerbread,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of me, would you not take me?&rdquo; said a tall
girl, who had a brow almost covered by her hair, heavy eyebrows joined
together, big drowned eyes, lips thick as eels and all red, and red,
too, of face, neck, and shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;burnt
bricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; said a girl of sixteen with a little squirrel
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like nut crunchers,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must whip him,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;with what? Fine
whips with a lash of dried hide. A sound lashing. The toughest skin
cannot resist it. Take ten of them. Carters&rsquo; and donkey
drivers&rsquo; whips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Ulenspiegel!&rdquo; cried Lamme. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have a bad heart,&rdquo; said Lamme, seeking his friend on
every side.</p>
<p>The whips were brought; two of the girls set to work to strip Lamme
of his doublet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my poor fat, that I had so much
trouble to make, they will doubtless lift it off with their keen whips.
But, pitiless females, my fat will be no use to you, not even to make
sauces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall make candles with it. Is it nothing to see clear
without paying for it! She that will henceforth say that out of the
whip comes forth candle will seem mad to everybody. We will uphold it
to the death, and win more than one wager. Steep the rods in vinegar.
There, your doublet is off. The hour is striking at Saint Jacques! Nine
o&rsquo;clock. At the last stroke of the clock, if you have not made
your choice, we shall strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme, paralyzed, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity and compassion upon me; I have sworn faithfulness
to my poor wife and will keep it, although she left me in evil fashion.
Ulenspiegel, dear friend, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel did not show himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See me,&rdquo; said Lamme to the light ladies, &ldquo;see me
at your knees. Is there a humbler posture? Is it not enough to say that
I honour your great beauties like the very saints? Happy is he that,
not being married, can enjoy your charms! &rsquo;Tis paradise, without
doubt; but do not beat me, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the <i>baesine</i>, who remained between her two candles,
spoke in a strong and threatening voice: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good women and girls,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I take my oath
on my great devil that if, in a moment, you have not, by laughter and
gentle ways, brought this man to a good mind, that is to say into your
bed, I will go fetch the night watch and have you all whipped instead
of him. Ye do not deserve to be called girls of amorous life if in vain
you have free mouth, wanton hand, and flaming eyes to excite the males,
as do the females of the glow-worms that have their lanterns but to
this end. And you shall be whipped without mercy for your
simpleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word the girls trembled and Lamme became joyful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, good women, what news bring you from the land of
sharp thongs? I will myself go and fetch the watch. They will do their
duty, and I shall help them with it. It will give me great
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then a pretty little girl of fifteen threw herself at
Lamme&rsquo;s knees:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you see me here before you,
humbly resigned; if you do not deign to choose me from among us, I must
needs be beaten for you, monsieur. And the <i>baesine</i> there will
put me into a foul cellar, under the Scheldt, where the water oozes
from the wall, and where I shall have but black bread to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she verily be beaten for me, Madame
<i>baesine</i>,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till the blood runs,&rdquo; replied she.</p>
<p>Lamme then, considering the girl, said: &ldquo;I see thee fresh,
perfumed, thy shoulder coming out from thy robe like a great petal of a
white rose; I would not have this lovely skin under which the blood
flows so young, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>suffer under the whip, nor that those eyes bright
with the fire of youth should weep for the anguish of the strokes, nor
that the cold of the prison should make thy body shiver, thy body like
a love fay. And so I had rather choose thee than know that thou wert
beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl took him away. So sinned he, as he did all things in his
life, through kindness of heart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ulenspiegel and a tall handsome brown girl with curling
waving hair were standing before one another. The girl, without saying
a word, was looking at Ulenspiegel coquettishly and seemed not to wish
to have anything to do with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love me,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love thee,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;wild lover who lovest only
at thine own hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel answered: &ldquo;The bird that passes above thy head
sings his song and flies away. And so with me, sweetheart: wilt thou
that we sing together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;a song of laughter and of
tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the girl flung herself on Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as both were happy in the arms of their darlings, lo!
there came into the house, to the sound of fife and drum, and jostling,
pushing, singing, whistling, crying, shouting, bawling, a gay company
of <i lang="nl">meesevangers</i>, who at Antwerp are titmouse catchers.
They were carrying bags and cages full of these little birds, and the
owls that had helped them in the sport were opening wide their eyes,
gilded in the light.</p>
<p>The <i lang="nl">meesevangers</i> were full ten in number, all red,
bloated with wine and cervoise ale, with waggling heads, dragging their
tottering legs and crying out in a voice so hoarse and so broken that
it seemed to the timid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=
"#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>girls that they were rather
listening to wild beasts in a wood than men in a house.</p>
<p>However, as they never stopped saying, speaking singly or all at
once: &ldquo;I would have the one I love.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are his that
pleaseth us. To-morrow to the rich in florins! To-day to the rich in
love!&rdquo; the <i lang="nl">meesevangers</i> replied: &ldquo;Florins
we have and love as well; to us then the light ladies. He that draws
back is a capon. These are tits, and we are sportsmen. Rescue! Brabant
for the good duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the women said, laughing loudly: &ldquo;Fie! the ugly muzzles
that think to eat us! &rsquo;Tis not to swine that men give sherbets.
We take whom we please and do not want you. Barrels of oil, bags of
lard, thin nails, rusty blades, you stink of sweat and mud. Get out of
here; you will be well and duly damned without our help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men: &ldquo;The Frenchies are dainty to-day. Disgusted
ladies, you can well give us what you sell to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the women: &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we will be
slaves and dogs, and will accept you; to-day we are free women and we
cast you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men: &ldquo;Enough words,&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Who is
thirsty? Let us pluck the apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying they threw themselves upon them, without distinction
of age or beauty. The girls, resolute in their minds, threw at their
heads chairs, quart pots, jugs, goblets, tankards, flasks, bottles,
raining thick as hail, wounding them, bruising them, knocking out their
eyes.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Lamme came down at the tumult, leaving their
trembling lovers above at the top of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>ladder. When
Ulenspiegel saw these men striking at the women, he took up a broom in
the courtyard, tore away the twigs from the head, gave another to
Lamme, and with them they beat the <i lang="nl">meesevangers</i>
without pity.</p>
<p>The game seemed hard to the drunkards; thus belaboured, they stopped
for an instant, by which profited the thin girls who desired to sell
themselves and not to give, even in this great day of love voluntary as
Nature wills it. Like snakes they glided among the injured, caressed
them, tended their wounds, drank wine of Amboise for them, and emptied
so well their pouches of florins and other moneys, that they had left
not a single liard. Then, as the curfew was ringing, they put them to
the door through which Ulenspiegel and Lamme had already taken their
way.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ulenspiegel and Lamme were marching towards Ghent and
came at daybreak to Lokeren. The earth in the distance sweated dew;
white cool mists glided along the meadows. Ulenspiegel, as he passed
before a forge, whistled like the lark, the bird of liberty. And
straightway appeared a head, tousled and white, at the door of the
forge, and imitated the warlike clarion of the cock in a weak
voice.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said to Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the <i>smitte</i> Wasteele, who forges by day spades,
mattocks, plough shares, hammering the iron when it is hot to fashion
with it fine gratings for the choirs of churches, and oftentimes, at
night, making and furbishing arms for the soldiers of freedom of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>conscience. He has not won the looks of health
at this game, for he is pale as a ghost, sad as a damned soul, and so
lean that his bones poke holes in his skin. He has not yet gone to
rest, having doubtless toiled all night long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, both of you,&rdquo; said the <i>smitte</i> Wasteele,
&ldquo;and lead your asses into the meadow behind the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This being done, Lamme and Ulenspiegel being in the forge, the
<i>smitte</i> Wasteele took down into a cellar of his house all the
swords he had furbished and the lance heads he had cast during the
night, and made ready the day&rsquo;s work for his men.</p>
<p>Looking at Ulenspiegel with lack-lustre eye, he said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news do you bring me from the Silent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prince has been driven out of the Low Countries with his
army because of the misconduct of his mercenaries, who shout
&lsquo;<i lang="nl">Geld, Geld!</i> money, money!&rsquo; when they
ought to fight. He has gone away towards France with the faithful
soldiers, his brother Count Ludovic and the Duke of Deux-Ponts, to help
the King of Navarre and the Huguenots; from thence he passed over into
Germany, to Dillenbourg, where many that have fled from the Low
Countries are with him. You must send him arms and what money you have
collected, while we, we shall ply the task of free men upon the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do what is to be done,&rdquo; said the <i>smitte</i>
Wasteele; &ldquo;I have arms and nine thousand florins. But did you not
come riding on asses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you not, on your way, heard news of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>three preachers, slain and stripped and thrown
into a hole among the rocks of the Meuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, with the utmost boldness,
&ldquo;these three preachers were three spies of the duke&rsquo;s,
assassins, paid to kill the prince of freedom. Together we two, Lamme
and I, sent them from life to death. Their money is ours and their
papers likewise. We shall take what we need from it for our journey;
the rest we shall give to the prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel, opening his own doublet and Lamme&rsquo;s, pulled
out from them papers and parchments. The <i>smitte</i> Wasteele having
read them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They contain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;plans of battle and
conspiracy. I will have them sent to the prince, and he will be told
that Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak, his trusty vagabonds, saved his
noble life. I will have your asses sold that you may not be recognized
from your mounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel asked the <i>smitte</i> Wasteele if the sheriff&rsquo;s
court at Namur had already set their catchpolls on their track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what I know,&rdquo; replied Wasteele.
&ldquo;A smith of Namur, a stout reformer, passed through here the
other day, under pretext of asking me to help him with the screens,
weathercocks, and other ironwork of a castle that is to be built near
the Plante. The usher of the sheriff&rsquo;s court told him that his
masters had already met, and that a tavern keeper had been summoned,
because he lived a few hundred fathom from the place where the murder
had taken place. Asked if he had seen the murderers or not, or any he
might suspect as such, he had replied: &lsquo;I saw country folk men
and women travelling on donkeys, asking me for something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>to
drink and staying seated on their mounts, or getting down to drink in
my house, beer for the men, hydromel for the women and girls. I saw two
bold rustics that talked of shortening Messire of Orange by a
foot.&rsquo; And so saying, the host, whistling, imitated the sound of
a knife going into the flesh of the neck. &lsquo;By the
Steel-wind,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I will speak with you in private,
being empowered to do so.&rsquo; He spoke and was released. From that
time the councils of justice have without doubt sent despatches to
their subordinate councils. The host said he had seen only country men
and country women riding upon asses; it will therefore follow that
pursuit will be directed against all persons that may be found
bestriding a donkey. And the prince hath need of you, my
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell the asses,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and keep the
price for the prince&rsquo;s treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The asses were sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must now,&rdquo; said Wasteele, &ldquo;have each a trade
free and independent of the guilds; do you know how to make bird cages
and mouse traps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made such long ago,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou?&rdquo; asked Wasteele of Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will sell <i lang="nl">eete-koeken</i> and <i lang=
"nl">olie-koeken</i>; these are pancakes and balls of flour cooked in
oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me; here are cages and mouse traps all ready; the
tools and copper filigree work also which are needed to mend them and
to make others. They were brought me by one of my spies. This is for
you, Ulenspiegel. As for you, Lamme, here is a little stove and a
bellows; I will give you flour, butter, and oil to make the <i lang=
"nl">eete-koeken</i> and the <i lang="nl">olie-koeken</i>.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He will eat them,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we make the first ones?&rdquo; asked Lamme.</p>
<p>Wasteele replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First ye shall help me for a night or two; I cannot finish my
great task alone by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;can one eat
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is bread and cheese,&rdquo; said Wasteele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No butter?&rdquo; asked Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No butter,&rdquo; said Wasteele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you beer or wine?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never drink them,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I will go
<i lang="nl">in het Pelicaen</i>, close by here, and fetch some for you
if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;and bring us some
ham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do as you wish,&rdquo; said Wasteele, looking at Lamme
with great disdain.</p>
<p>All the same he brought <i lang="nl">dobbel-clauwert</i> and a ham.
And Lamme, full of joy, ate enough for five.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we set to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; said Wasteele; &ldquo;but stay in the forge
and do not be afraid of my workmen. They are of the Reformed faith like
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>By night, the curfew having rung and the doors being shut, Wasteele,
making Ulenspiegel and Lamme help him, going down and bringing up from
his cellar heavy bundles of weapons:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are twenty arquebuses to mend,
thirty lance heads to furbish, and lead for fifteen hundred bullets to
melt down; you shall help me with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my hands,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and why
have I not four to serve you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme will help us,&rdquo; said Wasteele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; replied Lamme, piteously, and falling with
drowsiness through excess of drink and food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall melt the lead,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will melt the lead,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>Lamme, melting his lead and running his bullets, kept looking with a
savage eye at the <i>smitte</i> Wasteele who was driving him to keep
awake when he was dropping with sleep. He ran his bullets with a
wordless fury, having a great longing to pour the molten lead on the
head of Wasteele the smith. But he controlled himself. Towards
midnight, his rage getting the better of him at the same time as excess
of fatigue, he addressed him thus in a hissing voice, while the
<i>smitte</i> Wasteele with Ulenspiegel was patiently furbishing musket
barrels, muskets, and lance heads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;meager, pale, and
wretched, believing in the good faith of princes and the great ones of
the earth, and disdaining, in an excessive zeal, your body, your noble
body that you are leaving to perish in misery and humiliation. It was
not for this that God made it with Dame Nature. Do you know that our
soul which is the breath of life, needs, that it may breathe, beans,
beef, beer, wine, ham, sausages, chitterlings, and rest; you, you live
on bread, water, and watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence have you this talkative flow?&rdquo; asked
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows not what he says,&rdquo; answered Wasteele,
sadly.</p>
<p>But Lamme growing angry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know better than you. I say that we are mad, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>I,
you, and Ulenspiegel, to wear out our eyes for all these princes and
great ones of the earth, who would laugh loudly at us if they saw us
dying of weariness, losing our sleep to furbish up arms and cast
bullets for their service while they drink French wine and eat German
capons from golden tankards and dishes of English pewter; they will
never ask whether, while we are seeking in the open wild the God by
whose grace they have their power, their enemies are cutting off our
limbs with their scythes and casting us into the well of death. They,
in the meanwhile, who are neither Reformed, nor Calvinists, nor
Lutherans, nor Catholics, but sceptics and doubters entirely, will buy
or conquer principalities, will devour the wealth of the monks, abbeys,
and convents, and will have all: virgins, wives, women and <i>bona
robas</i>, and will drink from their gold cups to their perpetual
jollity, and to our everlasting foolishness, simplicity, stupidity, and
to the seven deadly sins which they commit, O <i>smitte</i> Wasteele,
under the starveling nose of thy enthusiasm. Look upon the fields, the
meads, look on the harvest, the orchards, the kine, the gold rising out
of the earth; look at the wild things in the woods, the birds of the
skies, delicious ortolans, delicate thrushes, wild boars&rsquo; heads,
haunches of buck venison; all is theirs, hunting, fishing, earth, sea,
everything. And you, you live on bread and water, and we are killing
ourselves here for them, without sleep, without eating, and without
drinking. And when we shall be dead they will fetch our carrion a kick
and say to our mothers: &lsquo;Make us more of these; those ones can do
us no service now.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel laughed and said nothing. Lamme <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>breathed hard with indignation, but Wasteele,
speaking in a gentle voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou speakest but lightly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I live not
for ham, for beer, or for ortolans, but for the victory of freedom of
conscience. The prince of freedom does even as I do. He sacrifices his
wealth, his sleep and his happiness to drive out from the Low Countries
the butchers and tyranny. Do as he does and try to grow thinner.
&rsquo;Tis not by the belly that peoples can be saved, but by proud
courage and fatigues endured even unto death without a murmur. And now
go and lie down, if thou art sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lamme would not, being ashamed.</p>
<p>And they furbished arms and cast bullets until it was morning, and
thus for three days.</p>
<p>Then they departed for Ghent, by night, selling bird cages,
mouse-traps, and <i lang="nl">olie-koekjes</i>.</p>
<p>And they stopped at Meulestee, the little town of the mills, whose
red roofs are seen everywhere, and there they agreed to carry on their
trades apart and to meet each other at night before curfew <i lang=
"nl">in de Zwaen</i>, at the Swan Inn.</p>
<p>Lamme wandered about the streets of Ghent selling <i lang=
"nl">olie-koekjes</i> getting a liking for this trade, seeking for his
wife, emptying many a quart pot and eating continually. Ulenspiegel had
delivered letters from the prince to Jacob Scoelap, licentiate in
medicine; to Lieven Smet, cloth seller; to Jan Wulfschaeger, to Gillis
Coorne, the scarlet dyer, and to Jan de Roose, tile maker, who gave him
the money harvested by them for the Prince, and bade him wait some days
longer at Ghent and in the neighbourhood, and he would be given still
more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=

their bodies were buried in the Gallows Field, near the Bruges
Gate.</p>

<p class="first">Meanwhile, the provost Spelle le Roux, armed with his
red wand, was hurrying from town to town on his lean horse, everywhere
setting up scaffolds, lighting fires of execution, digging graves to
bury poor women and girls alive in them. And the King inherited.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel being at Meulestee with Lamme, under a tree, found
himself full of weary lassitude. It was cold although the month was
June. From the skies, laden with gray clouds, there fell a fine
hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;you are for the past four
nights shamelessly running wild, gadding after the <i>bona robas</i>,
you go to sleep <i lang="nl">in de Zoeten Inval</i>, at the Sweet Fall;
you will do like the man on the sign, falling head foremost into a hive
of bees. Vainly do I wait for you <i lang="nl">in de Zwaen</i>, and I
draw evil forebodings from this liquorish living. Why do you not take a
wife virtuously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;he to whom one woman
is all women, and to whom all women are one in this gentle combat that
they call love, must not lightly rush upon his choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Nele, do you not think at all on her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nele is at Damme, far away,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel<span class="corr" id="xd20e2933" title=
"Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>While he was in this posture and the hail was falling thick, a young
and pretty woman passed by, running and covering up her head in her
petticoat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;dreamy one, what dost thou under
that tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am dreaming,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;of a woman
that should make me a roof against the hail with her
petticoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast found her,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Rise
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou leave me alone again?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;but go <i lang="nl">in
de Zwaen</i>, eat a leg of mutton or two, drink a dozen tankards of
beer; you will sleep and you will not be forlorn then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do that,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went up to the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up my skirt on one side,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will
lift it on the other, and now let us run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why run?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am fain to flee from
Meulestee; the provost Spelle is in it with two catchpolls and he has
sworn to have all the light ladies whipped if they will not pay him
five florins each. That is why I am running: run, too, and stay with me
to defend me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme,&rdquo; cried Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;Spelle is in
Meulestee. Go off and away to Destelberg, to the Star of the Wise
Men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme, getting up affrighted, took his belly in both hands and
began to run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither is this fat hare going?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a burrow where I shall find him again,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us run,&rdquo; said she, beating the ground with her foot
like a restive filly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would fain be virtuous without running,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel made answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fat hare wants me to renounce good wine, cervoise ale,
and the fresh skin of women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him with an ugly eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your breath is short; you must rest,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest myself? I see no shelter,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your virtue,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;will serve for a
quilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your petticoat better,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My petticoat,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;would not be
worthy to cover a saint such as you would fain be. Take yourself off
that I may run alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;that a
dog goes swifter with four feet than a man with two? And so, having
four feet, we shall run better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a lively tongue for a virtuous man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have always observed that
virtue is a quiet, sleepy, thick, and chilly quality. It is a mask to
hide grumbling faces, a velvet cloak on a man of stone. I like men that
have in their breast a stove well lighted with the fire of virility,
which exciteth to valiant and gay enterprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was ever thus,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;that the
lovely she-devil spake to the glorious Saint Anthony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an inn a score of paces from the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have spoken well,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;now you
must drink well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tongue is still cool and fresh,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>They went in. On a chest there slumbered a big jug nicknamed
&ldquo;belly,&rdquo; because of its wide paunch.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said to the <i lang="nl">baes</i>: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou see this florin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; said the <i>baes</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many patards would thou extract from it to fill up that
belly there with <i lang="nl">dobbel-clauwert</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="nl">baes</i> said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With <i lang="nl">negen mannekens</i> (nine little men), you
will be clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;is six Flanders mites,
and overmuch by two mites. But fill it, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel poured out a goblet for the woman, then rising up
proudly and applying the beak of the belly to his mouth, he emptied it
all every drop into his throat. And it was as the noise of a
cataract.</p>
<p>The girl, dumbfounded, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage to put so big a belly into your lean
stomach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, Ulenspiegel said to the <i lang="nl">baes</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a knuckle of ham and some bread, and another full
belly, that we may eat and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which they did.</p>
<p>While the girl was munching a piece of the rind he took her so
subtly, that she was startled, charmed, and compliant all at once.</p>
<p>Then questioning him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have they come to your
virtue, this thirst like a sponge, this wolf&rsquo;s hunger, and these
amorous audacities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having sinned a hundred ways, I swore, as you know, to do
penance. That lasted a whole long hour. Thinking during that hour upon
my life that was to come, I saw myself fed meagrely on bread, dully
refreshed with water; sadly fleeing from love; daring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>neither to move nor sneeze, for fear to commit
wickedness; esteemed by all, feared by each; alone like a leper; sad as
a dog orphaned of his master, and after fifty years of martyrdom,
ending by undergoing my death in melancholy fashion on a pallet. The
penance was long enough: so kiss me, my darling, and let us go out from
purgatory together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she, obeying cheerfully, &ldquo;what a good
sign virtue is to put on the end of a pole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passed in these amorous doings; nevertheless they must needs
rise and go, for the girl feared to see in the midst of their pleasure
the provost Spelle suddenly appear with his catchpolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truss up thy petticoat then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And they ran like stags towards Destelberg, where they found Lamme
eating at the Star of the Three Wise Men.</p>

<p class="first">Ulenspiegel often saw at Ghent, Jacob Scoelap, Lieven

fortune of the Silent.</p>
<p>And every time that Ulenspiegel came back to Destelberg<span class=

him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you bring? Good luck or bad luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;the Silent, his brother
Ludwig, the other chiefs and the Frenchmen were determined to go
farther into France and join with the Prince of Cond&eacute;. Thus they
would save the poor Belgian fatherland and freedom of conscience. God
willed it otherwise; the German reiters and landsknechts refused to go
farther, and said their oath was to go against the Duke of Alba and not
against France. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"

duty, the Silent was forced to take them through Champagne and Lorraine
as far as Strasbourg, whence they went back into Germany. All has gone
awry through this sudden and obstinate departure: the King of France,
despite his contract with the prince, refuses to give over the money he
promised; the Queen of England would have sent him money to get back
the town and the district of Calais; her letters were intercepted and
despatched to the Cardinal at Lorraine, who forged an answer in the
contrary sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus we see melt away, like ghosts at the crowing of the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The girl came one day, all weeping, to say to Lamme
and to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spelle is allowing murderers and robbers in Meulestee to
escape for money. He is putting the innocent to death. My brother
Michielkin is among them. Alas! Let me tell you, ye will avenge him,
being men. A vile and infamous debauchee, Pieter de Roose, an habitual
seducer of children and girls, does all the harm. Alas! my poor brother
Michielkin and Pieter de Roose were one evening, but not at the same
table, in the tavern of the <i lang="nl">Valck</i>, where Pieter de
Roose was avoided by every one like the plague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, not willing to see him in the same room as
himself, called him a lecherous blackguard, and ordered him to purge
the chamber of his presence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pieter de Roose replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The brother of a public baggage has no need to show
such a lofty nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lied. I am not public, and give myself only to whomsoever
I please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michielkin, then, flinging his quart of cervoise ale in his
face, told him he had lied like the filthy debauchee that he was,
threatening, if he did not decamp, to make him eat his fist up to the
elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other would have talked more, but Michielkin did what he
had said: he gave him two great blows on the jaw and dragged him by the
teeth, with which he was biting, out on to the road, where he left him
battered and bruised, without pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pieter de Roose, being healed, and unable to live a solitary
life, went <i lang="nl">in &rsquo;t Vagevuur</i>, a veritable purgatory
and a gloomy tavern, where there were none but poor people. There also
he was left to himself, even by all those ragamuffins. And no man spoke
to him, save a few country folk to whom he was unknown, and a few
wandering rogues, or deserters from some troop or other. He was even
beaten there several times, for he was quarrelsome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The provost Spelle had come to Meulestee with two catchpolls,
and Pieter de Roose followed them everywhere about like a dog, filling
them up at his expense with wine, with meat, and many other pleasures
that are bought with money. And so he became their companion and their
comrade, and he began to do his wicked best to torment all he hated;
which was all the inhabitants of Meulestee, but especially my poor
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all he attacked Michielkin. False witnesses,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>gallows birds, greedy for florins, declared that
Michielkin was a heretic, had uttered foulness about Notre Dame, and
oftentimes blasphemed the name of God and the saints in the tavern of
the Falcon, and that, besides all, he had full three hundred florins in
a coffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding that the witnesses were not of good life and
conduct, Michielkin was arrested, and the proofs being declared by
Spelle and the catchpolls good and sufficient to warrant putting the
accused to the torture, Michielkin was hung up by the arms to a pulley
fastened to the ceiling, and they put a weight of fifty pounds on each
of his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He denied the charge, saying that if in Meulestee there was a
rogue, a blackguard, a blasphemer and a lecherous brute, it was no
other than Pieter de Roose, and not he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Spelle would listen to nothing, and bade his catchpolls
hoist Michielkin right up to the ceiling, and to let him drop heavily
with his weights on his feet. And this they did, and so cruelly that
the skin and the muscles of the victim were torn, and that the foot
scarcely held to the leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Michielkin persisted in saying he was innocent, Spelle had
him tortured afresh, while giving him to understand that if he would
give him a hundred florins he would leave him free and acquitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michielkin said that he would die first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folk of Meulestee, having learned the fact of the arrest
and the torture, desired to be witness <i>par turbes</i>, which is the
testimony of all the reputable inhabitants of a commune.
&lsquo;Michielkin,&rsquo; said they, unanimously, &lsquo;is in no way
or guise heretical; he goes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>every Sunday to mass and to the
holy table; he has never said anything else of Our Lady than to call on
her to succour him in difficult circumstances; having never spoken ill,
even of an earthly woman, he would much less ever have dared to speak
ill of the heavenly Mother of God. As for the blasphemies that the
false witnesses declared they had heard him utter in the tavern of the
Falcon, that was in all points false and lies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michielkin having been released, the false witnesses were
punished, and Spelle cited Pieter de Roose before his court, but set
him free without examination or torture, in consideration of one
hundred florins paid down in one sum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pieter de Roose, fearing that the money he still had left
might attract Spelle&rsquo;s attention to him once again, fled from
Meulestee, while Michielkin, my poor brother, died of the gangrene that
had caught hold of his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who no longer wished to see me, yet had me sent for to bid
me beware well of the fire in my body that would bring me into the fire
of hell. And I could but weep, for the fire is within me. And he gave
up his soul in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;he who would avenge upon Spelle
the death of my beloved kind Michielkin would be my master forever, and
I would obey him like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she spake, the ashes of Claes beat upon the breast of
Ulenspiegel. And he determined to bring Spelle the murderer to the
gallows.</p>
<p>Boelkin (that was the girl&rsquo;s name) returned to Meulestee, well
assured in her home against the vengeance of Pieter de Roose, for a
cattle dealer, passing by Destelberg, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>informed her that the
cur&eacute; and the townsfolk had declared that if Spelle touched
Michielkin&rsquo;s sister, they would cite him before the duke.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, having followed her to Meulestee, came into a low
chamber in Michielkin&rsquo;s house, and saw there a portrait of a
master pastry cook which he supposed to be that of the poor
victim....</p>
<p>And Boelkin said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my brother&rsquo;s portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel took the picture and said, going away:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spelle shall be hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you would have no
pleasure in seeing it done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boelkin nodded her head and said in a grieving voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You show no confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;showing you extreme
confidence to say to you &lsquo;Spelle shall be hanged!&rsquo; For with
this mere word alone you can have me hanged before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;go fetch me good
potter&rsquo;s clay, a double quart of <i lang="nl">bruinbier</i>,
clear water, and a few slices of beef. All separate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beef will be for me, the <i lang="nl">bruinbier</i> for
the beef, the water for the clay, and the clay for the
portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eating and drinking Ulenspiegel kneaded the clay, and now and then
swallowed a morsel of it, but heeded it little, and looked most
attentively at Michielkin&rsquo;s portrait. When the clay was kneaded,
he made a mask out of it, with a nose, a mouth, eyes, ears so much like
the portrait of the dead man, that Boelkin was astonied at it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that he put the mask in the oven, and when it was dry, he
painted it the colour corpses are, showing the haggard eyes, the solemn
face, and the various contractions of a man in the act of dying. Then
the girl, ceasing to be astonied, looked at the mask, without being
able to take her eyes off it, grew pale and livid, covered up her face,
and said shuddering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he, my poor Michielkin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made also two bloody feet.</p>
<p>Then having conquered her first fright:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed will he be,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that will slay
the murderer.&rdquo; Ulenspiegel, taking the mask and the feet,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have an assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boelkin replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go <i lang="nl">in den Blauwe Gans</i>, to the Blue Goose, to
Joos Lansaem of Ypres, who keeps this tavern. He was my brother&rsquo;s
best friend and comrade. Tell him it is Boelkin that sends
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel did as she bade him.</p>
<p>After having laboured for death, the provost Spelle went to drink
<i lang="nl">in&rsquo;t Valck</i>, at the Falcon, a hot mixture of
<i lang="nl">dobbel-clauwert</i>, with cinnamon and Madeira sugar. They
dared refuse him nothing at his inn, for fear of the rope.</p>
<p>Pieter de Roose, having plucked up courage again, had come back to
Meulestee. Everywhere he followed Spelle and his catchpolls to have
their protection. Sometimes Spelle paid the wherewithal for him to
drink. And they drank up merrily the money of the victims.</p>
<p>The inn of the Falcon was not filled now as in the good days when
the village lived joyously, serving God after the Catholic fashion; and
not tormented because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>of religion. Now it was as though
in mourning, as could be seen from its numerous houses that were empty
or shut up, from its deserted streets in which there wandered a few
starved dogs searching among the rubbish heaps for their rotten
food.</p>
<p>There was no place now in Meulestee for any but the two evil and
cruel men. The timid dwellers in the village saw them by day insolent
and noting the houses of future victims, drawing up the lists of death;
and by night venturing from the Falcon singing filthy choruses, while
two catchpolls, drunk like them, followed them armed to the teeth to be
their escort.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went <i lang="nl">in den Blauwe Gans</i>, to the Blue
Goose, to Joos Lansaem, who was at the bar.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel took from his pocket a little flask of brandy, and said
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boelkin has two casks for sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into my kitchen,&rdquo; said the <i>baes</i>.</p>
<p>There, shutting the door, and looking fixedly at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are no brandy merchant; what do these winkings of your
eyes mean? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the son of Claes that was burned at Damme; the ashes of
the dead man beat upon my breast; I would fain kill Spelle, the
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Boelkin who sends you?&rdquo; asked the host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boelkin sends me,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;I will
kill Spelle; you shall help me in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the <i>baes</i>. &ldquo;What must I
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the cur&eacute;, the good pastor, an enemy to Spelle.
Assemble your friends together and be with them to-morrow, after the
curfew, on the Everghem road, above <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>Spelle&rsquo;s house,
between the Falcon and the house aforesaid. All post yourselves in the
shadows and have no white on your clothes. At the stroke of ten you
will see Spelle coming out from the tavern and a wagon coming from the
other side.<a id="xd20e3278" name="xd20e3278"></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not tell your friends to-night; they sleep too near to
their wives&rsquo; ears. Go and find them to-morrow. Come, now, listen
to everything closely and remember well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall remember,&rdquo; said Joos. And raising his goblet:
&ldquo;I drink to Spelle&rsquo;s halter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the halter,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. Then he went back
with the <i>baes</i> into the tavern chamber where there sate drinking
certain old clothes merchants of Ghent who were coming back from the
Saturday market at Bruges, where they had sold for high prices doublets
and short mantles of cloth of gold and silver bought for a few sous
from ruined nobles who desired by their luxury and splendour to imitate
the Spaniards.</p>
<p>And they kept revels and feasting because of their big profits.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Joos Lansaem, sitting in a corner, as they drank,
and without being heard, agreed that Joos should go to the cur&eacute;
of the church, a good pastor, incensed against Spelle, the murderer of
innocent men. After that he would go to his friends.</p>
<p>On the morrow, Joos Lansaem and Michielkin&rsquo;s friends, having
been forewarned, left the <i lang="nl">Blauwe Gans</i>, where they had
their pints as usual, and so as to conceal their plans went off at
curfew by different ways, and came to the Everghem causeway. They were
seventeen in number.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock Spelle left the Falcon, followed by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>his two catchpolls and Pieter de Roose. Lansaem
and his troop were hidden in the barn belonging to Samson Boene, a
friend of Michielkin. The door of the barn was open. Spelle never saw
them.</p>
<p>They heard him pass by, staggering with drink like Pieter de Roose
and his two catchpolls also, and saying, in a thick voice and with many
hiccups:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provosts! provosts! life is good to them in this world; hold
me up, gallows birds that live on my leavings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly were heard upon the road, from the direction of the open
country, the braying of an ass and the crack of a whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a restive donkey indeed,&rdquo; said Spelle,
&ldquo;that won&rsquo;t go on in spite of that good warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly they heard a great noise of wheels and a cart leaping along
and coming down the middle of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; cried Spelle.</p>
<p>As the cart passed beside them, Spelle and his two catchpolls threw
themselves on the donkey&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cart is empty,&rdquo; said one of the catchpolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lubber,&rdquo; said Spelle, &ldquo;do empty carts gallop
about by night all alone? There is somebody in this cart a-hiding;
light the lanterns, hold them up, I am going to look in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lanterns were lighted and Spelle climbed up on the cart, holding
his own lamp; but scarcely had he looked than he uttered a great cry,
and falling back, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michielkin! Michielkin! Jesu! have pity upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there rose up from the floor of the cart a man <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>clad
in white as pastry cooks are and holding in his hands two bloody
feet.</p>
<p>Pieter de Roose, seeing the man stand up, illuminated by the
lanterns, cried with the two catchpolls:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michielkin! Michielkin, the dead man! Lord have pity upon
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seventeen came at the noise to look at the spectacle and were
affrighted to see in the light of the clear moon how like was the image
of Michielkin, the poor deceased.</p>
<p>And the ghost waved his bleeding feet.</p>
<p>It was his same full round visage, but pale through death,
threatening, livid, and eaten under the chin by worms.</p>
<p>The ghost, still waving his bleeding feet, said to Spelle, who was
groaning, lying flat on his back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spelle, Provost Spelle, awake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Spelle never moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spelle,&rdquo; said the ghost again, &ldquo;Provost Spelle,
awake or I fetch thee down with me into the mouth of gaping
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spelle got up, and with his hair straight up for terror, cried
lamentably:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michielkin! Michielkin, have pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the townsfolk had come up, but Spelle saw nothing save
the lanterns, which he took for the eyes of devils. He confessed as
much later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spelle,&rdquo; said the ghost of Michielkin, &ldquo;art thou
prepared to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the provost, &ldquo;nay, Messire
Michielkin; I am nowise prepared for it, and I would not appear before
God with my soul all black with sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou know me?&rdquo; said the ghost. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;May God be my helper,&rdquo; said Spelle, &ldquo;yea, I know
thee; thou art the ghost of Michielkin, the pastry cook, who died,
innocently in his bed, of the after effects of torture, and the two
bleeding feet are those upon each of which I had a weight of fifty
pounds hung. Ha! Michielkin, forgive me, this Pieter de Roose was so
strong a tempter; he offered me fifty florins, which I accepted, to put
thy name on the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou desire to confess thyself?&rdquo; said the
ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, Messire, I desire to confess myself, to tell all and do
penance. But deign to send away these demons that are there, ready to
devour me. I will tell all. Take away those fiery eyes! I did the same
thing at Tournay, with respect to five townsmen; the same at Bruges,
with four. I no longer know their names, but I will tell them you if
you insist; elsewhere, too, I have sinned, lord, and of my doing there
are nine and sixty innocents in the grave. Michielkin, the king needed
money. I had been informed of that, but I needed money even likewise;
it is at Ghent, in the cellar, under the pavement, in the house of old
Grovels my real mother. I have told all, all: grace and mercy! Take
away the devils. Lord God, Virgin Mary, Jesus, intercede for me: save
me from the fires of hell, I will sell all I have, I will give
everything to the poor, and I will do penance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, seeing that the crowd of the townsmen was ready to
uphold him, leapt from the cart at Spelle&rsquo;s throat and would have
strangled him.</p>
<p>But the cur&eacute; came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him live,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is better that he
should die by the executioner&rsquo;s rope than by the fingers of a
ghost.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with him?&rdquo; asked
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accuse him before the duke and have him hanged,&rdquo;
replied the cur&eacute;. &ldquo;But who art thou?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;am the mask of
Michielkin and the person of a poor Flemish fox who is going back into
his earth for fear of the Spanish hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pieter de Roose was running away at full speed.</p>
<p>And Spelle having been hanged, his goods were confiscated.</p>
<p>And the king inherited.</p>

<p class="first">The next day Ulenspiegel went towards Courtray, going
alongside the Lys, the clear river.</p>
<p>Lamme went pitifully along.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You whine, cowardly heart, regretting the wife that made you
wear the horned crown of cuckoldom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;she was always faithful,
loving me enough as I loved her over well, sweet Jesus. One day, being
gone to Bruges, she came back thence changed. From then, when I prayed
her of love, she would say to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must live with you as a friend, and not
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sad in my heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beloved darling,&rsquo; I would say, &lsquo;we were
married before God. Did I not for you everything you ever wished? Did
not I many a time clothe myself with a doublet of black linen and a
fustian cloak that I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>might see you clad in silk and brocade
despite the royal ordinances? Darling, will you never love me
again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I love thee,&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;according to
God and His laws, according to holy discipline and penance. Yet I shall
be a virtuous companion to thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I care naught for thy virtue,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;&rsquo;tis thou I want, thou, my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nodding her head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know thou art good,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;until
to-day thou wast cook in the house to spare me the labour of
fricassees; thou didst iron our blankets, ruffs, and shirts, the irons
being too heavy for me; thou didst wash our linen, thou didst sweep the
house and the street before the door, so as to spare me all fatigue.
Now I desire to work instead of you, but nothing more,
husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is all one to me,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I will
be, as in the past, thy tiring maid, thy laundress, thy cook, thy
washwoman, thy slave, thy very own, submissive; but wife, sever not
these two hearts and bodies that make but one; break not that soft bond
of love that clasped us so tenderly together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; I would say, &lsquo;was it at Bruges that
thou didst come to this harsh resolve?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have sworn before God and His saints.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who, then,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;forced thee to take
an oath not to fulfil your duties as a wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He that hath the spirit of God, and ranks me among the
number of his penitents,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that moment she ceased to be mine as much as if she had
been the faithful wife of another man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>I implored her,
tormented her, threatened her, wept, begged, but in vain. One night,
coming back from Blanckenberghe, where I had been to receive the rent
of one of my farms, I found the house empty. Without doubt fatigued
with my entreaties, grieved and sad at my distress, my wife had taken
flight. Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme sat down on the bank of the Lys, hanging his head and
looking at the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear, how plump, tender, and
delicious thou wast! Shall I ever find a lass like thee? Daily bread of
love, shall I never eat of thee again? Where are thy kisses, as full of
fragrance as thyme; thy delicious mouth whence I gathered pleasure as
the bee gathers the honey from the rose; thy white arms that wrapped me
round caressing? Where is thy beating heart, thy round bosom, and the
sweet shudder of thy fairy body all panting with love? But where are
thy old waves, cool river that rollest so joyously thy new waves in the
sunshine?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 id="xd20e3442" class="main">XXXIV</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Passing before the wood of Peteghem, Lamme said to
Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am roasting hot; let us seek the shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>They sat down in the wood, upon the grass, and saw a herd of stags
pass in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look well, Lamme,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, priming his German
musket. &ldquo;There are the tall old stags that still have their
dowcets, and carry proud and stately their nine-point antlers; lovely
brockets, that are their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>squires, trot by their side, ready
to do them service with their pointed horns. They are going to their
lair. Turn the musket lock as I do. Fire! The old stag is wounded. A
brocket is hit in the thigh; he is in flight. Let us follow him till he
falls. Do as I do: run, jump, and fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is my mad friend,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;following
stags on foot. Fly not without wings; it is labour lost. You will never
catch them. Oh! the cruel comrade! Do you imagine I am as agile as you?
I sweat, my son; I sweat and I am going to fall. If the ranger catches
you, you will be hanged. Stag is kings&rsquo; game; let them run, my
son, you will never catch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;do you hear the noise
of his antlers in the foliage? It is a water spout passing. Do you see
the young branches broken, the leaves strewing the ground? He has
another bullet in his thigh this time; we will eat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not cooked yet,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;Let these
poor beasts run. Ah! how hot it is! I am going to fall down there
without doubt and I shall never rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, on all sides, men clad in rags and armed filled the
forest. Dogs bayed and dashed in pursuit of the stags. Four fierce
fellows surrounded Lamme and Ulenspiegel and brought them into a
clearing, in the middle of a brake, where they saw encamped there,
among women and children, men in great numbers, armed diversely with
swords, arbalests, arquebuses, lances, pikestaff, and reiter&rsquo;s
pistols.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, seeing them, said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye the leafmen or Brothers of the Woods, that ye seem to
live here in common to flee the persecution?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Brothers of the Woods,&rdquo; replied an old man
sitting beside the fire and frying some birds in a saucepan. &ldquo;But
who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;am of the goodly
country of Flanders, a painter, a rustic, a noble, a sculptor, all
together. And through the world in this wise I journey, praising things
lovely and good and mocking loudly at all stupidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou hast seen so many countries,&rdquo; said the ancient
man, &ldquo;thou canst pronounce: <i lang="nl">Schild ende Vriendt</i>,
buckler and friend, in the fashion of Ghent folk; if not, thou art a
counterfeit Fleming and thou shalt die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel pronounced: <i lang="nl">Schild ende Vriendt</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, big belly,&rdquo; asked the ancient man, speaking
to Lamme, &ldquo;what is thy trade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To eat and drink my lands, farms, fees, and revenues, to seek
for my wife, and to follow in all places my friend
Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou hast travelled so much,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;thou art not without knowledge of how they call the folk of
Weert in Limbourg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know it,&rdquo; replied Lamme; &ldquo;but would you
not tell me the name of the scandalous vagabond who drove my wife from
her home? Give it to me; I will go and slay him straightway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient man made answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things in this world which never return once
having taken flight: they are money spent and a woman grown tired and
run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then speaking to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how they call the men
of Weert in Limbourg?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>De reakstekers</i>, the exorcisers of skates,&rdquo;
replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;for one day a live ray having fallen from a
fishmonger&rsquo;s cart, old women seeing it leap about took it for the
devil. &lsquo;Let us go fetch the cur&eacute; to exorcise the
skate,&rsquo; said they. The cur&eacute; exorcised it, and carrying it
off with him, made a noble fricassee in honour of the folk of Weert.
Thus may God do with the bloody king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the barking of the dogs re&euml;choed in the forest. The
armed men, running in the wood, were shouting to frighten the
beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the stag and the brocket I put up,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall eat him,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;But how do
they call the folk of Eindhoven in Limbourg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>De pinnemakers</i>, boltmakers,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;One day the enemy was at the gate of their city;
they bolted it with a carrot. The geese came and ate the carrot with
great pecks of their greedy beaks, and the enemies came into Eindhoven.
But it will be iron beaks that will eat the bolts of the prisons
wherein they seek to lock up freedom of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God be with us, who shall be against us?&rdquo; replied
the ancient man.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs baying, men shouting, branches broken; &rsquo;tis a
storm in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it good meat, stag meat?&rdquo; asked Lamme, looking at
the fricassees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cries of the trackers come nearer,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel to Lamme; &ldquo;the dogs are close at hand. What thunder!
The stag! the stag! take care, my son. Fie! the foul beast; he has
flung my big friend down to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>earth in the midst of the
pans, saucepans, cooking pots, boilers, and fricassees. There are the
women and girls fleeing daft with fright. You are bleeding, my
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are laughing, scoundrel,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;Aye, I
am bleeding; he hath landed his antlers in my seat. There, see my
breeches torn, and my flesh, too, and all those lovely fricassees on
the ground. There, I am losing all my blood down my hose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stag is a foresighted surgeon; he is saving you from an
apoplexy,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie! rascal without a heart,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;But I
will follow you no more. I will stay here in the midst of these good
fellows and these good women. Can you, without any shame, be so
hardhearted to my woes, when I walk at your heels like a dog, through
snow, frost, rain, hail, wind, and when it is hot weather, sweating my
very soul out through my skin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wound is nothing. Clap an <i lang="nl">olie-koekje</i>
on it; that will be both plaster and fry to it,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;But do you know how they call the folk of Louvain?
You do not know it, poor friend. Well, then, I am about to tell you to
keep you from whimpering. They call them <i lang="nl">de
koeye-schieters</i>, cow shooters, for they were one day silly enough
to fire on cows, which they took for enemy soldiers. As for us, we fire
on Spanish goats; their flesh is stinking stuff, but their skin is good
to make drums withal. And the folk of Tirlemont? Do you know it? Not
that, either. They carry the proud nickname of <i lang=
"nl">kirekers</i>. For in their town, in the great church, on Whit
Sunday, a drake flies from the rood-loft altar, and that is the image
of their Holy Ghost. Put a <i lang="nl">koeke-bakke</i> on your wound.
You pick up without a word the cooking pots <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>and
fricassees overturned by the stag. &rsquo;Tis kitchen courage. You
relight the fire, and set up the soup pot again upon its three stakes;
you are busying yourself very attentively with the cooking. Do you know
why there are four wonders in Louvain? No. I will tell you why. In the
first place, because the living there pass underneath the dead, for the
church of Saint-Michel is built close to the gate of the town. Its
graveyard is therefore above. Secondly, because the bells there are
outside the towers, as is seen at the church of Saint-Jacques, where
there is a great bell and a little bell; being unable to place the
little one inside the bell tower, they placed it outside. Thirdly,
because of the Tower-without-Nails, because the spire of the church of
Saint-Gertrude is made of stone instead of being made of wood, and
because men do not nail stones, except the bloody king&rsquo;s heart
which I would fain nail above the great gate of Brussels. But you are
not listening to me. Is there no salt in the sauces? Do you know why
the folk of Tirlemont call themselves warming pans, <i lang="nl">de
vierpannen</i>? Because a young prince being come in winter to sleep at
the inn of the <i>Arms of Flanders</i>, the innkeeper did not know how
to air the blankets, for he had no warming pan. He had the bed aired by
his daughter, who, hearing the prince coming, made off running, and the
prince asked why they had not left the warming pan in the bed. May God
bring it about that Philip, shut in a box of red-hot iron, may serve as
warming pan in the bed of Madame Astarte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me in peace,&rdquo; said Lamme; &ldquo;a fig for you,
your <i>vierpannen</i>, the Tower-without-Nails, and the rest of your
nonsense. Leave me to my sauces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;The barkings cease
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>not to re&euml;cho; they become louder; the dogs
are roaring, the bugle is sounding. Beware of the stag. You are taking
flight! The bugle sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the death quarry,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;come
back, Lamme, to your fricassees, the stag is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a good meal for us,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;You
will invite me to the feast, because of the trouble I am taking for
you. The sauce for the birds will be good: it crunches a little,
however. That is the sand on which they fell when that big devil of a
stag tore my doublet and me all together. But are you not afraid of the
foresters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too numerous,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;they are
afraid and do not disturb us. It is even the same with the catchpolls
and the judges. The inhabitants of the towns love us, for we do no harm
to any man. We shall live some time longer in peace, unless the Spanish
army surrounds us. If that happens, old men and young men, women,
girls, lads, and lasses, we will sell our lives dear, and we will kill
one another rather than endure a thousand martyrdoms at the hands of
the bloody duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now no longer the time to combat the murderer by land.
It is on the sea that we must ruin his power. Go to the Zealand
Islands, by way of Bruges, Heyst, and Knoeke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no money,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are a thousand carolus from the prince. Follow along the
waterways, canals, rivers, and streams; when you see ships carrying the
sign &lsquo;J. H. S.,&rsquo; let one of you sing like a lark. The
clarion of the cock <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>will answer him. And you will be in
friends&rsquo; country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will do this,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>Soon the hunters, followed by the dogs, appeared, pulling after them
the dead stag with ropes.</p>
<p>Then all sate down round about the fire. There were full sixty, men,
women, and children. Bread was pulled out from satchels, knives from
their sheaths; the stag, cut up, stripped, disembowelled, was put on
the spit with small game. And at the end of the meal Lamme was seen
snoring with his head drooped on his breast and sleeping propped
against a tree.</p>
<p>At nightfall, the Brothers of the Wood went back into huts
constructed underground to sleep, and Lamme and Ulenspiegel did the
same.</p>
<p>Armed men kept watch, guarding the camp. And Ulenspiegel heard the
dry leaves protest under their feet.</p>
<p>The next day he departed with Lamme, while the men of the camp
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be thou; we will make towards the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At Harlebek, Lamme renewed his stock of <i lang=
"nl">olie-koekjes</i>, ate twenty-seven and put thirty in his basket.
Ulenspiegel carried his cages in his hand. Towards evening they arrived
in Courtray and stopped at the inn of <i lang="nl">in de Bie</i>, the
Bee, with Gilis van den Ende, who came to his door as soon as he heard
someone sing like the lark.</p>
<p>There it was all sugar and honey with them. The host having seen the
prince&rsquo;s letters, handed fifty carolus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>to
Ulenspiegel for the prince, and would take no payment for the turkey he
served them, nor for the <i lang="nl">dobbel-clauwert</i> with which he
washed it down. He warned them, too, that there were at Courtray spies
of the Court of Blood, for which cause he ought to well keep his tongue
as well as his companion&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall reconnoitre then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel and
Lamme.</p>
<p>And they went out from the inn.</p>
<p>The sun was setting, gilding the gables of the houses; the birds
were singing under the lime trees; the goodwives gossiped on the
thresholds of their doors; the children rolled and tumbled about in the
dust, and Ulenspiegel and Lamme wandered haphazard through the
streets.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin van den Ende, asked by me if he had seen a woman like
my wife&mdash;I drew him my pretty portrait,&mdash;told me that there
were at the house of the woman Stevenyne, on the Bruges road, at the
<i>Rainbow</i>, outside the town, a great number of women who gather
there every evening. I am going there straightway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find you again presently,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;I wish to pay the town a visit; if I meet your wife I will
presently send her to you. You know that the <i lang="nl">baes</i> has
enjoined on you to be silent, if you have any regard for your
skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ulenspiegel wandered at his will, the sun went down, and the day
falling swiftly, he arrived in the <i lang="nl">Pierpot-Straetje</i>,
which is the lane of the Stone Pot. There he heard the viol played upon
melodiously; drawing near he saw from afar a white shape calling him,
gliding away from him and playing on the viol. And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>it
sang like a seraph a sweet slow song, stopping, turning back, still
calling him and fleeing from him.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel ran swiftly; he overtook her and was about to speak
to her when she laid on his mouth a hand perfumed with benjamin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou a rustic or a nobleman?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to pay for a great pleasure, not enough to ransom my
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou no horses, that thou goest afoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an ass,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;but I left him
in the stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it thou art alone, without a friend, in a strange
city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my friend is wandering on his own side, as I am on
mine, my curious darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not curious,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Is he rich, your
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fat,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;Will you soon have
finished questioning me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;now leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave you?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;as well bid Lamme, when he
is hungry, leave a dish of ortolans. I want to eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not seen me,&rdquo; she said. And she opened a
lantern which shone out suddenly, lighting up her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are beautiful,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;Ho! the
golden skin, the sweet eyes, the red mouth, the darling body! All will
be for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She brought him to the woman Stevenyne&rsquo;s, on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>Bruges road, at the Rainbow (<i lang="nl">in den
Reghen-boogh</i>). Ulenspiegel saw there a great number of girls
wearing on their arms armlets of a colour different from that of their
fustian dress.</p>
<p>This one had an armlet of silver cloth on a robe of cloth of gold.
And all the girls looked at her jealously. Coming in she made a sign to
the <i lang="nl">baesine</i>, but Ulenspiegel never saw it. They sat
down together and drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that whoever has loved
me is mine forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely fragrant girl,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;&rsquo;twould be a delicious feast to me to eat always of this
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he perceived Lamme in a corner, with a little table before
him, a candle, a ham, a pot of beer, and not knowing how to rescue his
ham from the two girls, who wanted perforce to eat and drink with
him.</p>
<p>When Lamme perceived Ulenspiegel, he stood up and leaped three feet
into the air, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be God, that restoreth my friend Ulenspiegel to me!
Something to drink, <i lang="nl">baesine</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, pulling out his purse, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring to drink till this is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he made the carolus clink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory to God!&rdquo; said Lamme, craftily taking the purse in
his hands; &ldquo;it is I that pay and not you; this purse is
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel wished to get back his purse from him by force, but
Lamme held on tenaciously. As they were fighting, the one to keep it,
the other to get it back, Lamme speaking disjointedly, said in low
tones to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen: ... catchpolls within ... four <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>...
little room with three girls ... two outside for you, for me ... would
have gone out ... prevented.... The brocade girl a spy ... a spy,
Stevenyne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were struggling, Ulenspiegel, listening with all his
ears, cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give back my purse, rascal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall never get it,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>And they seized each other by the neck and the shoulders, rolling on
the ground while Lamme gave his good advice to Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Suddenly the <i>baes</i> of the Bee came in followed by seven men,
whom he seemed not to know. He crowed like a cock and Ulenspiegel
whistled like a lark. Seeing Ulenspiegel and Lamme fighting, the
<i>baes</i> spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these two fellows?&rdquo; he asked the Stevenyne.</p>
<p>The Stevenyne answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogues that it would be better to separate rather than leave
them here to make such an uproar before going to the
gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him dare to separate us,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;and we will make him eat the tiled floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>baes</i> to the rescue,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel in
Lamme&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Hereupon the <i>baes</i>, scenting some mystery, rushed into their
battle, head down. Lamme threw these words into his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the rescuer? How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baes pretended to shake Ulenspiegel by the ears and said to him
in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven for thee ... strong fellows, butchers ... I&rsquo;m
going away ... too well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>known in town.... When I am gone,
<i lang="nl">&rsquo;tis van te beven de klinkaert</i> ... smash
everything ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, getting up and fetching him a
kick.</p>
<p>The <i lang="nl">baes</i> struck him in his turn. And Ulenspiegel
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hit thick and fast, my belly boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As hail,&rdquo; said the baes, seizing Lamme&rsquo;s purse
lightly and giving it to Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogue,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pay for me to drink now that
you have been restored to your property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt drink, scandalous rascal,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how impudent he is,&rdquo; said the Stevenyne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As insolent as thou art lovely, darling,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Now the Stevenyne was full sixty years old, and had a face like a
medlar, but all yellowed with bile and anger. In the middle of it was a
nose like an owl&rsquo;s beak. Her eyes were the eyes of a
flinty-hearted miser. Two long dog-tusks jutted from her fleshless
mouth. And she had a great port-wine stain on her left cheek.</p>
<p>The girls laughed, mocking her and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling, darling, give him somewhat to
drink&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He will kiss you&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Is it
long since you had your first spree?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take care,
Ulenspiegel, she will eat you up&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Look at her eyes;
they are shining not with hate but with love&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You
might say she will bite you to death&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All amorous women are like
that&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;She only wants your
money&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;See what a good laughing humour she is
in.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>And indeed the Stevenyne was laughing and winking at Gilline, the
girl in the brocade dress.</p>
<p>The <i lang="nl">baes</i> drank, paid, and went. The seven butchers
made faces of intelligence at the catchpolls and the Stevenyne.</p>
<p>One of them indicated by a gesture that he held Ulenspiegel for a
ninny and that he was about to fool him to the top of his bent. He said
in his ear, putting out his tongue derisively on the side of the
Stevenyne who was laughing and showing her fangs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de klinkaert</i>&rdquo;
(&rsquo;tis time to make the glasses clink).</p>
<p>Then aloud, and pointing to the catchpolls:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentle reformer, we are all with thee; pay for us to drink
and to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Stevenyne laughed with pleasure and also put out her tongue
at Ulenspiegel when he turned his back to her. And Gilline of the
brocade dress put out her tongue likewise.</p>
<p>And the girls said, whispering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the spy who by her beauty brought to cruel torture
and more cruel death more than twenty-seven of the Reformed faith;
Gilline is in ecstasy thinking of the reward for her
informing&mdash;the first hundred florins carolus of the victim&rsquo;s
estate. But she does not laugh when she thinks that she must share them
with the Stevenyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all, catchpolls, butchers, and girls, put out their tongues to
mock at Ulenspiegel. And Lamme sweated great drops of sweat, and he was
red with anger like a cock&rsquo;s comb, but he would not speak a
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay for us to drink and to eat,&rdquo; said the butchers and
the catchpolls. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141"
name="pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, rattling his carolus
again, &ldquo;give us to drink and to eat, O darling Stevenyne, to
drink in ringing glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the girls began to laugh anew and the Stevenyne to stick
out her tusks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she went to the kitchens and to the cellar; she
brought back ham, sausages, omelettes of black puddings, and ringing
glasses, so called because they were mounted on felt and rang like a
chime when they were knocked.</p>
<p>Then Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him that is hungry eat; let him that is thirsty
drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The catchpolls, the girls, the butchers, Gilline, and the Stevenyne
applauded this speech with feet and hands. Then they all ranged
themselves as well as they could, Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and the seven
butchers at the principal table, the great table of honour, the
catchpolls and the girls at two small tables. And they drank and ate
with a great noise of jaws, even the two catchpolls that were outside,
and whom their comrades made come in to share the feast. And ropes and
chains could be seen sticking out from their satchels.</p>
<p>The Stevenyne then putting out her tongue and grinning said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can go without paying me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went and shut all the doors, the keys of which she put in
the pockets.</p>
<p>Gilline, lifting her glass, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird is in the cage, let us drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon two girls called Gena and Margot said to her: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this another one that you are going to have put to death,
wicked woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Gilline, &ldquo;let us
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the three girls would not drink with her.</p>
<p>And Gilline took her viol and sang, in French:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;To viol&rsquo;s tone I sing</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Neath night or noonday skies,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=

<p>As she sang her song, Gilline was so beautiful, so sweet, and so
pretty that all the men, catchpolls, butchers, Lamme, and Ulenspiegel
were there, speechless, moved, smiling, captivated by the spell.</p>
<p>All at once, bursting into laughter, Gilline said, looking at
Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the way birds are put in the cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the spell was broken.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and the butchers looked at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, will you pay me?&rdquo; said the Stevenyne,
&ldquo;will you pay me, Messire Ulenspiegel, you that grow so fat on
the flesh of preachers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme would have spoken, but Ulenspiegel made him hold his tongue,
and speaking to the Stevenyne:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not pay in advance,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pay myself afterwards then out of your estate,&rdquo;
said the Stevenyne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghouls feed on corpses,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said one of the catchpolls, &ldquo;those two have
taken the preachers&rsquo; money; more than three hundred florins
carolus. That makes a fine tithe for Gilline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilline sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Seek such in other spheres</p>
<p class="line">Take all, my loving squire,</p>
<p class="line">Pleasures, kisses, and tears,</p>
<p class="line">And Death, if you desire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then, laughing, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink!&rdquo; said the catchpolls. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said the Stevenyne, &ldquo;let us
drink! The doors are locked, the windows have stout bars, the birds are
in the cage, let us drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink,&rdquo; said the seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink,&rdquo; said the catchpolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drink,&rdquo; said Gilline, making her viols
sing. &ldquo;I am beautiful; let us drink. I could take the Archangel
Gabriel in the nets of my singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring us to drink then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;wine
to crown the feast, wine of the best; I would have a drop of liquid
fire at every hair of our thirsty bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us drink!&rdquo; said Gilline; &ldquo;twenty gudgeons
more like you, and the pikes will sing no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stevenyne brought wine. All were sitting, drinking and eating,
the catchpolls and the girls together. The seven, seated at the table
of Ulenspiegel and Lamme, threw, from their table to the girls, hams,
sausages, omelettes, and bottles, which they caught in the air like
carps snatching flies on the surface of a pond. And the Stevenyne
laughed, sticking out her tusks and showing packets of candles, five to
the pound, that hung above the bar. These were the girls&rsquo;
candles. Then she said to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When men go to the stake, they carry a tallow candle on the
way thither; would you like to have one now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink up!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink up,&rdquo; said the seven.</p>
<p>Said Gilline:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel has eyes shining like a swan about to die.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose they were given to the pigs to eat?&rdquo; said the
Stevenyne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a feast of lanterns; drink up!&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like,&rdquo; said the Stevenyne, &ldquo;when you
are on the scaffold, to have your tongue thrust through with a red-hot
iron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be the better of that for whistling; drink
up,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would talk less if you were hanged,&rdquo; said the
Stevenyne, &ldquo;and your darling might come to look at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;but I should weigh
heavier, and would fall on your lovely muzzle: drink up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you say if you were beaten with cudgels, branded
on the forehead and on the shoulder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say they had made a mistake in the meat,&rdquo;
replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and that instead of roasting the sow
Stevenyne, they had scalded the young porker Ulenspiegel: drink
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you do not like any of these,&rdquo; said the
Stevenyne, &ldquo;you shall be taken on to the king&rsquo;s ships, and
there condemned to be torn asunder by four galleys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;the sharks will have my
four quarters, and you shall eat what they reject: drink up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not eat one of these candles,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;they would serve you in hell to light your eternal
damnation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see clear enough to behold your shiny snout, O ill-scalded
sow, drink up!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Suddenly he struck the foot of the glass on the table, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>imitating with his hands the noise an
upholsterer makes beating rhythmically the wool of a mattress upon a
frame of sticks, but very gently, and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis (tydt) van te beven de
klinkaert</i>&rdquo; (it is time to make the clinker shiver&mdash;the
glass that rings).</p>
<p>This is in Flanders the signal for the angry outbreak of drinkers
and for the sacking of houses with the red lantern.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel drank, then made the glass quiver on the table,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de
klinkaert.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the seven imitated him.</p>
<p>All kept very still. Gilline grew pale, the Stevenyne appeared
astonished. The catchpolls said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the seven on their side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the butchers, winking, reassured them, at the same time
continually repeating in louder and louder tones with Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de klinkaert; &rsquo;tis
van te beven de klinkaert.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stevenyne drank to give herself courage.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then struck the table with his fist, with the rhythm and
measure of upholsterers beating mattresses; the seven did as he did;
glasses, jugs, bowls, quart pots, and goblets came slowly into the
dance, overturning, breaking, rising on one side to fall on the other;
and still there rang out more threatening, sombre, warlike, and in
monotone: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de
klinkaert.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Stevenyne, &ldquo;they are going to
smash everything here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in her fear her two tusks stuck farther still out of her mouth.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the blood lit up with wrath and fury in the minds of the seven
and Lamme and Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Then without stopping their monotonous threatening chant all the men
at Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s table took their glasses, and breaking them on
the table, keeping time together, they got astride their chairs and
drew their cutlasses. And they made such a din with their song that all
the window-panes in the house were quaking. Then like a ring of devils
they went round about the chamber and all the tables, saying
continually: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de
klinkaert.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the catchpolls then rose up quaking with terror, and took out
their ropes and chains. But the butchers, Ulenspiegel, and Lamme,
thrusting their cutlasses back into their sheaths, got up, seized their
chairs, and brandishing them like cudgels, they ran nimbly through the
room hither and thither, striking right and left, sparing only the
girls, smashing all the rest, furniture, windows, chests, dishes, quart
pots, bowls, glasses, and flasks, beating the catchpolls without pity
and always singing to the time of the sound of the upholsterer beating
mattresses: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de klinkaert;
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis van te beven de klinkaert</i>,&rdquo; while
Ulenspiegel had given a blow on the face with his fist to the
Stevenyne, had taken her keys from her bag, and by force made her eat
her candles.</p>
<p>The beauteous Gilline, tearing at the doors, the shutters, the
windows, and the glass panes with her nails, seemed to want to scratch
her way through everything, like a terrified cat. Then, all livid, she
crouched down in a corner, with haggard eyes, showing her teeth, and
holding her viol as if she must needs protect it at all costs.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>The seven and Lamme said to the girls: &ldquo;We will do you no
hurt&rdquo;; with their help tied up with their own chains and cords
the catchpolls shivering in their shoes and not daring to resist, for
they perceived that the butchers, picked out among the strongest by the
<i lang="nl">baes</i> of the Bee, would have chopped them to pieces
with their cutlasses.</p>
<p>At every candle he made the Stevenyne eat Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is for the hanging; that for the cudgelling; this other
for the branding; this fourth for my pierced tongue; these two
excellent and extra fat ones for the king&rsquo;s ships and the
quartering by four galleys; this for your den of spies; that one for
your damsel in the brocade dress, and all these others just to please
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the girls laughed to see the Stevenyne sneezing with anger and
trying to spit out her candles. But in vain, for she had her mouth too
full of them.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and the seven never ceased singing in time with
one another: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de
klinkaert.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ulenspiegel stopped, making sign to them to murmur the refrain
softly. They did so while he held this conversation with the girls and
the catchpolls:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any one of you cries for help, he will be cut down
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut down!&rdquo; said the butchers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will hold our tongues,&rdquo; said the girls, &ldquo;do
not hurt us, Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gilline, huddled in her corner, her eyes starting out of her
head, her teeth out of her mouth, could not speak, and clasped her viol
tightly to her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"
name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the seven still were murmuring: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis
van te beven de klinkaert!</i>&rdquo; in measure.</p>
<p>The Stevenyne, pointing to the candles she had in her mouth, made
signs that she would hold her tongue likewise. The catchpolls promised
the same.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel continued his discourse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in our power; the night
has fallen, we are near the Lys where you drown easily if you are
thrust in. The gates of Courtrai are closed. If the night watch have
heard the uproar, they will never budge, being too lazy and thinking it
is simply good Flemish folk who as they drink are singing merrily to
the sound of pots and flasks. Wherefore stay ye still, both men and
girls, before your masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, speaking to the seven:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to Peteghem to find the Beggars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made ready for this at the news of thy coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From thence ye will go to the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know among these catchpolls one or two that might be
let go to serve us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;Niklaes and Joos, who never
hunted down the poor Reformed folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are faithful!&rdquo; said Niklaes and Joos.</p>
<p>Then Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are twenty florins carolus for you, twice more than you
would have had if ye had taken the vile reward of the
informer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the five others exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty florins! We will serve the prince for twenty florins.
The king pays ill. Give each of us the half; we will tell the judge
whatever you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butchers and Lamme murmured low: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de klinkaert; &rsquo;tis
van te beven de klinkaert.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that ye may not talk too much,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;the seven will bring you bound as far as Peteghem, to the
Beggars. Ye shall have ten florins when ye are on the sea; we shall be
certain till then that the camp victual will keep you faithful to bread
and soup. If ye are valiant men, ye shall have your share in the booty
taken. If ye try to desert, ye shall be hanged. If ye escape, thus
avoiding the rope, ye shall find the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We serve who pays us,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;Tis van te beven de klinkaert! &rsquo;Tis
van te beven de klinkaert!</i>&rdquo; said Lamme and the seven striking
upon the table with shards of broken pots and glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shall take with you also,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;Gilline, the Stevenyne, and the three damsels. If one of them
tries to escape, ye shall sew her up in a sack and throw her into the
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not killed me,&rdquo; said Gilline, leaping out from
her corner, and brandishing her viol in the air. And she sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Of blood was all my dream</p>
<p class="line">The dream so near my heart,</p>
<p class="line">Of Eve the child I seem,</p>
<p class="line">Of Satan, too, a part.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Stevenyne and the others were like to weep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear nothing, darlings,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;you
are so soft and sweet, that everywhere they will love you, feast you,
and caress you. At every war capture ye shall have your share in the
booty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will give nothing to me, for I am an old woman,&rdquo;
wept the Stevenyne. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A sou a day, crocodile,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;for
thou shalt be serving woman to these four beauteous damsels; thou shalt
wash their petticoats, blankets, and chemises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Lord God!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast ruled them long, living on the earnings of their
bodies and leaving them poor and hungry. Thou mayst whine and bellow,
it shall be as I have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the four girls began to laugh and mock at the Stevenyne,
and say to her, putting out their tongues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To each her turn in this world. Who would have said it of
Stevenyne the miser? She shall work for us as a servant. Blessed be the
lord Ulenspiegel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the three turned to Gilline:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wast her daughter, her support; thou didst share with
her the fruits of thy foul spydom. Wilt thou ever dare again to strike
and insult us with thy brocade dress? Thou didst scorn us because we
were but fustian. Thou art clothed so richly only with the blood of
victims. Let us take her dress so that she may be even like
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not have it,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And Gilline, leaping on his neck, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be thou that hast not killed me, and wouldst not have
me ugly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the girls, jealous, looked at Ulenspiegel, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has lost his wits for her like all the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilline sang to her viol.</p>
<p>The seven set out towards Peteghem, taking with them the catchpolls
and the girls along by the Lys. As they went on their way they
murmured: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">&rsquo;T is van te beven de klinkaert; &rsquo;t
is van te beven de klinkaert!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sun was rising they came to the camp, sang like the lark, and
the clarion of the cock made them answer. The girls and the catchpolls
were closely guarded. For all that, on the third day Gilline was found
dead, her heart pierced through with a great needle. The Stevenyne was
accused by the three girls and brought before the captain of the band,
his dizeniers and sergeants formed into a tribunal. There, without
their having to put her to the torture, she confessed that she had
killed Gilline through jealousy of her beauty and rage because the
damsel treated her as her servant pitilessly. And the Stevenyne was
hanged, and afterwards buried in the wood.</p>
<p>Gilline, too, was buried, and the prayers for the dead were said
above her sweet body.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two catchpolls instructed by Ulenspiegel had gone
before the castellan of Courtray, for the tumult, uproar, and pillage
made in the Stevenyne&rsquo;s house must needs be punished by the said
castellan, as the Stevenyne&rsquo;s house was in the castle ward,
outside the jurisdiction of the town of Courtray. After having narrated
to the lord castellan what had taken place, they told him with great
conviction and humble sincerity of language:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murderers of the preachers are in no wise Ulenspiegel and
his trusty and well-beloved Lamme Goedzak, who went to the
<i>Rainbow</i> purely for their repose and refreshment. They even have
passes from the duke, and we have seen these ourselves. The real
culprits are two Ghent merchants, one a lean man and the other very
fat, who went away towards France, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153"
href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>after breaking everything at
Stevenyne&rsquo;s, taking her away with her four girls along with them
for their pleasure. We had them well and duly taken prisoners, but
there were in the house seven butchers, the strongest in the town, who
took their side. They tied us all up and only let us go when they were
far away on the French soil. And here are the marks of the ropes. The
four other catchpolls are on their tracks, waiting for a reinforcement
to lay hands on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The castellan gave each of them two carolus and a new coat for their
loyal services.</p>
<p>He then wrote to the Council of Flanders, to the Sheriff&rsquo;s
Court at Courtray, and to other courts of justice to announce to them
that the real murderers had been discovered.</p>
<p>And he recounted to them the whole adventure in detail and at
length.</p>
<p>Whereat the people of the Council of Flanders and the other courts
of justice shuddered.</p>
<p>And the castellan was greatly praised for his perspicacity.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel and Lamme journeyed in peace upon the road from
Peteghem to Ghent, along the Lys, wishing to arrive at Bruges, where
Lamme hoped to find his wife, and at Damme, where Ulenspiegel, all
a-dream, would have wished to be already, to see Nele, who lived in
sadness with Katheline the madwife.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During a long while, in the country of Damme and round
about, there had been committed several abominable crimes. Lasses,
young men, old men, who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>been known to go forth carrying
money in the direction of Bruges, Ghent, or some other town or village
of Flanders, were found dead, naked as worms and bitten in the back of
the neck by teeth so long and so sharp that they all had the bones of
their necks broken.</p>
<p>Physicians and barber-surgeons declared that these were the teeth of
a huge wolf. &ldquo;Robbers,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;had doubtless
come up, after the wolf, and had stripped the victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite all search, no man could ever discover who were the robbers.
Soon the wolf was forgotten.</p>
<p>Several townsmen of note, who had proudly set forth on their way
without an escort, disappeared without any one knowing what had become
of them, save that at times some country fellow, going out in the
morning to plough the earth, found wolf tracks in his field, while his
dog, digging in the furrows with his paws, brought to light a poor dead
corpse carrying the marks of the wolf&rsquo;s teeth on the nape or
under the ear, and oftentimes on the leg, too, and always behind. And
always the neckbone and legbone were broken.</p>
<p>The peasant, affrighted, would go off at once to give information to
the bailiff, who would come with the clerk of the court, two aldermen,
and two surgeons to the place where lay the body of the murdered man.
Having visited it diligently and carefully, having sometimes when the
face was not eaten by worms recognized its quality, even its name and
lineage, they were nevertheless always astonied that the wolf, a beast
that kills for hunger, should not have carried off some part of the
dead man.</p>
<p>And the folk of Damme were sore terrified, and no woman dared to go
out by night without an escort. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now it came that several valiant soldiers were sent out to look for
the wolf, with orders to hunt for it day and night in the dunes, along
by the sea.</p>
<p>They were then near Heyst, among the great dunes. Night had come.
One of them, confident in his strength, wanted to leave them to go
alone on the hunt, armed with a musket. The others allowed him, certain
that, valiant and armed as he was, he would kill the wolf if he dared
to show himself.</p>
<p>Their comrade having gone, they lit a fire and played at dice while
drinking brandy out of their flasks.</p>
<p>And from time to time they called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, comrade, come back; the wolf is afraid; come and
drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he made no answer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, hearing a great cry as of a man that is at the point of
death, they ran in the direction whence the cry came, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, we are coming to the rescue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they were long before they found their comrade, for some said
the cry came from the valley, others that it came from the highest
dune.</p>
<p>At length, when they had well searched dune and valley with their
lanterns, they found their comrade bitten in the leg and in the arm,
from behind, and his neck broken like the other victims.</p>
<p>Lying on his back, he was holding his sword in his clenched fist;
his musket was on the sand. By his side were three severed fingers,
which they carried off, and which were not his fingers. His pouch had
been taken.</p>
<p>They took up on their shoulders their comrade&rsquo;s body, his good
sword, and his gallant musket, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"
href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>grieved and angry, they
carried the corpse to the bailiff&rsquo;s where the bailiff received
them in the company of the clerk of the court, two aldermen, and two
surgeons.</p>
<p>The severed fingers were examined and recognized as the fingers of
an old man, who was no worker at any trade, for the fingers were long
and tapering, and the nails were long as the nails of lawyers and
churchmen.</p>
<p>Next day the bailiff, the aldermen, the clerk, the surgeons, and the
soldiers went to the place where the poor slain man had been bitten,
and saw that there were drops of blood upon the grass and footmarks
that went as far as the sea, where they ceased.</p>

<p class="first">It was at the time of the ripened grapes, in the wine
month and the fourth day of it, when in the city of Brussels they
throw, from the top of the tower of Saint Nicholas after high mass,
bags of walnuts down to the people.</p>
<p>At night Nele was awakened by cries coming from the street. She
looked for Katheline in the room and found her not. She ran down and
opened the door, and Katheline came in saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! Save me! the wolf! the wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nele heard in the country far-off howlings. Trembling, she
lighted all the lamps, wax tapers, and candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened, Katheline?&rdquo; said she, clasping her
in her arms.</p>
<p>Katheline sat down, with haggard eyes, and said, looking at the
candles: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the sun, he driveth away evil spirits. The wolf,
the wolf is howling in the countryside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;why did you leave your bed
where you were warm, to go and take a fever in the damp nights of
September?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katheline said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanske cried last night like an osprey; and I opened the
door. And he said to me: &lsquo;Take the drink of vision,&rsquo; and I
drank. Hanske is goodly to look upon. Take away the fire. Then he
brought me down to the canal and said to me: &lsquo;Katheline, I will
give thee back the seven hundred carolus; thou shalt restore them to
Ulenspiegel the son of Claes. Here be two to buy thee a robe; thou
shalt have a thousand soon.&rsquo; &lsquo;A thousand,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;my beloved, I shall then be rich.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou shalt have
them,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;But is there none in Damme who, woman or
damsel, is now as rich as thou wilt be?&rsquo; &lsquo;I know
not,&rsquo; I answered. But I had no mind to tell their names for fear
he might love them. Then he said to me: &lsquo;Find this out and tell
me their names when I come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air was chill, the mist rolled over the meadows, the dry
twigs were falling from the trees upon the roadway. And the moon was
shining, and there were fires on the water of the canal. Hanske said to
me: &lsquo;It is the night of the were-wolves; all guilty souls come
forth out of hell. Thou must make the sign of the cross thrice with the
left hand and cry: Salt! Salt! Salt! which is the emblem of
immortality, and they will do thee no hurt.&rsquo; And I said: &lsquo;I
shall do what thou desirest, Hanske, my darling.&rsquo; He kissed me,
saying: &lsquo;Thou art my wife.&rsquo; &lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; said I. And
at his gentle word a heavenly happiness glided over my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>body
like an ointment. He crowned me with roses and said to me: &lsquo;Thou
art fair.&rsquo; And I said to him: &lsquo;Thou art fair, too, Hanske,
my darling, and goodly in thy fine raiment of green velvet with gold
trimmings, with thy long ostrich feather that floats from thy bonnet,
and thy face pale as the fire upon the waves of the sea. And if the
girls of Damme saw thee, they would all run after thee, beseeching thee
for thy heart; but thou must give it only to me alone, Hanske.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Endeavour to know which are the richest; their fortune
will be for thee.&rsquo; Then he went away, leaving me after straitly
forbidding me to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed there, chinking the three carolus in my hand, all
shivering and frozen by reason of the mist, when I saw coming up from a
steep bank and climbing the slope a wolf that had a green face and long
reeds among his white hair. I cried out: Salt! Salt! Salt! making the
sign of the cross, but he seemed to be in no dread of it. And I ran
with all my might, I crying, he howling, and I heard the dry clashing
of his teeth close upon me, and once so near to my shoulder that I
thought that he was about to catch me. But I ran faster than he did. By
great good luck, I met at the corner of the street of the Heron the
night watch with his lantern. &lsquo;The wolf! the wolf!&rsquo; I
cried. &lsquo;Be not afraid,&rsquo; said the watchman to me, &lsquo;I
will take you home, Katheline the madwife.&rsquo; And I felt that his
hand, holding me, was shaking. And he was afraid like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he hath got back his courage,&rdquo; said Nele. &ldquo;Do
you hear him now chanting in a drawling voice: <i lang="nl">&lsquo;De
clock is tien tien aen de clock&rsquo;:</i> It is ten o&rsquo; the
clock, o&rsquo; the clock ten! And he springs his rattle.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=

<p>&ldquo;Take away the fire,&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;my head
burns. Come back, Hanske, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nele looked on Katheline, and she prayed Our Lady the Virgin to
take away from her head the fire of madness; and she wept over her
mother.</p>

<p class="first">At Belleau, on the banks of the Bruges canal,
Ulenspiegel and Lamme met a horseman wearing three cock&rsquo;s
feathers in his felt hat and riding at full speed towards Ghent.
Ulenspiegel sang like a lark and the horseman, pulling up, answered
with the clarion of Chanticleer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou bring tidings, headlong horseman?&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great tidings,&rdquo; said the horseman. &ldquo;On the advice
of M. de Ch&acirc;tillon who is in the land of France the admiral of
the sea, the prince of freedom hath given commissions to equip ships of
war, beyond those that are already armed at Emden and in East Frisia.
The valiant men who have received these commissions are Adrien de
Berghes, Sieur de Dolhain; his brother Louis of Hainaut; the Baron of
Montfaucon; the Sieur Louis de Brederode; Albert d&rsquo;Egmont the son
of the beheaded count and no traitor like his brother; Berthel Enthens
of Mentheda, the Frisian; Adrien Menningh; Hembuyse the hot and proud
man of Ghent; and Jan Brock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prince hath given all his having, more than fifty
thousand florins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have five hundred for him,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them to the sea,&rdquo; said the horseman. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he went off at a gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gives all his having,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;We
others, we give nothing but our skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that nothing then,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;and shall we
never have aught talked of but sack and massacre? The orange is on the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;on the ground, like the
oak; but with the oak they build the ships of freedom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his profit,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;But since there is
no danger now, let us buy asses again. I like to march sitting, for my
part, and without having a chime of blister-bells on the soles of my
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us buy asses,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;these are
beasts it is easy to sell again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to market and found there, by paying for them, two fine
asses with their equipment.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As they rode on astraddle, they came to Oost-Camp,
where there is a great wood the fringe of which touched the canal.</p>
<p>Seeking therein shade and sweet fragrance, they went into it,
without seeing anything but the long forest alleys going in every
direction towards Bruges, Ghent, South Flanders, and North
Flanders.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ulenspiegel jumped down from his ass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou see nothing yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, I see.&rdquo; And trembling: &ldquo;My wife, my good
wife! &rsquo;Tis she, my son. Ha! I cannot walk to her. To find her
thus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you complaining of?&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;She is beautiful thus half-naked, in this muslin tunic cut in
open work that lets the fresh skin be seen. That one is too young; she
is not your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;it is she, my son; I know
her. Carry me. I can go no more. Who would have thought it of her? To
dance clad in this way like an Egyptian, shamelessly! Aye, it is she;
see her shapely legs, her arms bare to the shoulder, her breasts round
and golden half emerging from her muslin tunic. See how with that red
flag she excites that great dog jumping up at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a dog of Egypt,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel;
&ldquo;the Low Countries give none of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egypt ... I do not know.... But it is she. Ha! my son, I can
see no more. She plucks up her breeches higher to show more of her
round legs. She laughs to show her white teeth, and loudly to let the
sound of her sweet voice be heard. She opens her tunic at the top and
throws herself back. Ha! that swan neck amorous, those bare shoulders,
those bright bold eyes! I run to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he leaped from his ass.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel, stopping him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is not your wife. We are
near a camp of Egyptians. Beware.... See you the smoke behind the
trees? Hear you the barking of the dogs? There, here are some looking
at us, ready to bite perhaps. Let us hide deeper in the
brake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not hide,&rdquo; said Lamme; &ldquo;this woman is
mine, as Flemish as ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind and madman,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind, nay! I see her well, dancing, half-naked, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>laughing and teasing this great dog. She feigns
not to see us. But she does see us, I assure you. Thyl, Thyl! there is
the dog hurling himself on her and throws her down to have the red
flag. And she falls, uttering a plaintive cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme suddenly dashed towards her, saying to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, my wife! where are you hurt, darling? Why do you
laugh so loud? Your eyes are haggard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he kissed her and caressed her and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That beauty spot you had under the left breast, I see it not.
Where is it? Thou art not my wife. Great God of Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she never stopped laughing.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ulenspiegel cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard thee, Lamme!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme, turning about, saw before him a great blackamoor of an
Egyptian, of a sour countenance, brown as <i lang="nl">peper-koek</i>,
which is ginger bread in the land of France.</p>
<p>Lamme picked up his pikestaff, and putting himself to his defence,
he cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the rescue, Ulenspiegel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was there with his good sword.</p>
<p>The Egyptian said to him in High German:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="de">Gibt mi ghelt, ein Richsthaler auf
tsein.</i>&rdquo; (Give me money, a ricksdaelder or ten.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;the girl goes away
laughing loudly and even turning round to ask to be
followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="de">Gibt mi ghelt</i>,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;Pay for your amours. We are poor folk and wish you no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme gave him a carolus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What trade dost thou follow?&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All trades,&rdquo; replied the Egyptian: &ldquo;being master
of arts in suppleness, we do miraculous and magic tricks. We play on
the tambourine and dance Hungarian dances. More than one among us make
cages and gridirons to roast fine carbonadoes therewith. But all,
Flemings and Walloons, are feared of us and drive us forth. As we
cannot live by trade, we live by marauding, that is to say, on
vegetables, meat, and poultry that we must needs take from the peasant,
since he will neither give nor sell them to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence comes this girl, who is so like to my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is our chief&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; said the
blackamoor.</p>
<p>Then speaking low like a man in fear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was smitten by God with the malady of love and knows
naught of woman&rsquo;s modesty. As soon as she seeth a man, she
entereth on gaiety and wildness, and laughs without ceasing. She saith
little; she was long thought to be dumb. By night, in sadness, she
stays before the fire, weeping at whiles or laughing without reason,
and pointing to her belly, where, she saith, she hath a hurt. At the
hour of noon, in summer, after the meal, her sharpest madness cometh
upon her. Then she goeth to dance near naked on the outskirts of the
camp. She will wear naught but raiment of tulle or muslin, and in
winter we have great trouble to cover her with a cloak of cloth of
goat&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;hath she not some man friend
to prevent her from abandoning herself thus to all comers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hath none,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;for travellers,
coming near her and beholding her eyes distraught, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>have
more of fear than desire for her. This big man was a bold one,&rdquo;
said he, pointing to Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him talk, my son,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;it is
the <i lang="nl">stockvisch</i> slandering the whale. Which of the two
is the one that gives most oil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a sharp tongue this morning,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel, without listening to him, said to the Egyptian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doth she when others are as bold as my friend
Lamme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Egyptian answered sadly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she hath pleasure and gain. Those who win her pay for
their delight, and the money serves to clothe her and also for the
necessities of the old men and the women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She obeyeth none then?&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>The Egyptian answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us allow those whom God hath smitten to do as they wish.
Thus he marks his will. And such is our law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Lamme went away. And the Egyptian returned thence to
his camp, grave and proud. And the girl, laughing wildly, danced in the
clearing.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Going on their way to Bruges, Ulenspiegel said to
Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have disbursed a heavy sum of money in the enlisting of
soldiers, in payment to the catchpolls, the gift to the Egyptian girl,
and those innumerable <i>olie-koekjes</i> that it pleased you to eat
without ceasing rather than to sell a single one. Now notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>your belly-will, it is time to live more
circumspectly. Give me your money. I will keep the common
purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; said Lamme. And giving it to him:
&ldquo;All the same, do not leave me to die of hunger,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;for think on it, big and strong as I am, I must have substantial
and abundant nourishment. It is well for you, a thin and wretched
fellow, to live from hand to mouth, eating or not eating what you pick
up, like planks that live on air and rain on the quays. But for me,
whom air hollows and rain hungers, I must needs have other
feasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have them,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;feasts
of virtuous Lents. The best filled paunches cannot resist them;
deflating little by little, they make the heaviest light. And presently
will Lamme my darling be seen sufficiently thinned down, running like a
stag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;What henceforth will be my
starveling fate? I am hungry, my son, and would fain have
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night was falling. They arrived in Bruges by the Ghent gate. They
showed their passes. Having had to pay one demi-sol for themselves and
two for their asses, they entered into the town; Lamme, thinking of
Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s word, seemed brokenhearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we have supper, soon?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>They alighted <i>in de Meermin</i>, at the Siren, a weathercock
which is fixed all in gold above the gable of the inn.</p>
<p>They put their asses in the stable, and Ulenspiegel ordered, for his
supper and Lamme&rsquo;s, bread, beer, and cheese.</p>
<p>The host grinned when serving this lean meal: Lamme ate with hungry
teeth, looking in despair at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>Ulenspiegel labouring with his
jaws upon the too-old bread and the too-young cheese, as if they had
been ortolans. And Lamme drank his small beer with no pleasure.
Ulenspiegel laughed to see him so miserable. And there was also someone
that laughed in the courtyard of the inn and came at whiles to show her
face at the window. Ulenspiegel saw that it was a woman that hid her
face. Thinking it was some sly servant he thought no more of it, and
seeing Lamme pale, sad, and livid because of his thwarted belly loves,
he had pity and thought of ordering for his companion an omelette of
black puddings, a dish of beef and beans, or any other hot dish, when
the <i>baes</i> came in and said, doffing his headgear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If messires the travellers desire a better supper, they will
speak and say what they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme opened wide eyes and his mouth wider still and looked at
Ulenspiegel with an anguished distress.</p>
<p>The latter replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wandering workmen are not rich men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It nevertheless happens,&rdquo; said the <i lang=
"nl">baes</i>, &ldquo;that they do not always know all their
possessions.&rdquo; And pointing to Lamme: &ldquo;That good phiz is
worth two. What would Your Lordships please to eat and to
drink&mdash;an omelette with fat ham, <i lang="nl">choesels</i>, we
made some to-day, castrelins, a capon melting under the tooth, a fine
grilled carbonado with a sauce of four spices, <i lang=
"nl">dobbel-knol</i> of Antwerp, <i lang="nl">dobbel-cuyt</i> of
Bruges, wine of Louvain prepared after the manner of Burgundy? And
nothing to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring all,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>The table was soon laid, and Ulenspiegel took his delight to see
poor Lamme who, more famished than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>ever, precipitated himself
upon the omelette, the <i lang="nl">choesels</i>, the capon, the ham,
the carbonadoes, and poured down his throat in quarts the <i lang=
"nl">dobbel-knol</i>, the <i lang="nl">dobbel-cuyt</i> and the Louvain
wine prepared after the manner of Burgundy.</p>
<p>When he could eat no more, he puffed with comfort like a whale, and
looked about him over the table to see if there was nothing left to put
under his tooth. And he ate the crumbs of the castrelins.</p>
<p>Neither he nor Ulenspiegel had seen the pretty face look smiling
through the panes, pass and repass in the courtyard. The <i lang=
"nl">baes</i> having brought some wine mulled with cinnamon and Madeira
sugar, they continued to drink. And they sang.</p>
<p>At the curfew, he asked them if they would go upstairs each to his
large and goodly bedchamber. Ulenspiegel replied that a small one would
suffice for them both. The <i>baes</i> replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none such; ye shall each have a lord&rsquo;s chamber,
and nothing to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed and in verity he brought them into chambers richly
adorned with furniture and carpets. In Lamme&rsquo;s there was a great
bed.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, who had well drunk and was falling with sleep, left him
to go to bed and promptly did likewise.</p>
<p>The next day, at the hour of noon, he entered Lamme&rsquo;s chamber
and saw him sleeping and snoring. Beside him was a pretty little
satchel full of money. He opened it and saw it was gold carolus and
silver patards.</p>
<p>He shook Lamme to wake him. The other came out of his sleep, rubbed
his eyes and, looking round him uneasily, said: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife! where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And showing an empty place beside him in the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was there but now,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Then leaping out of the bed, he looked everywhere again, searched in
all the nooks and corners of the chamber, the alcove and the cupboards,
and said, stamping his foot:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife! Where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>baes</i> came up at the noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rascal,&rdquo; said Lamme, catching him by the throat,
&ldquo;where is my wife? What hast thou done with my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impatient tramper,&rdquo; said the <i>baes</i>, &ldquo;thy
wife? What wife? Thou didst come alone. I know naught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! he knows naught,&rdquo; said Lamme, ferreting once more
in all the nooks and corners of the room. &ldquo;Alas! she was there,
last night, in my bed, as in the time of our good loves. Aye. Where art
thou, my darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And flinging the purse on the ground:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not thy money I want, &rsquo;tis thou, thy sweet
body, thy kind heart, O my beloved! O heavenly joys! Ye will come back
no more. I had grown hardened not to see thee, to live without love, my
sweet treasure. And lo, having come to me again, thou dost abandon me.
But I will die. Ha! my wife? Where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he wept with scalding tears on the ground where he had cast
himself. Then all at once opening the door, he started to run
throughout the whole of the inn, and into the street, in his shirt,
crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife? Where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But soon he came back, for the mischievous boys hooted him and threw
stones at him.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said to him, forcing him to clothe himself:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be so overwhelmed; you shall see her again, since you
have seen her. She loves you still, since she came back to you, since
it was doubtless she that paid for the supper and for the lordly
chambers, and that put on your bed this full pouch. The ashes tell me
that this is not the doing of a faithless wife. Weep no more, and let
us march forth for the defence of the land of our fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us still remain in Bruges,&rdquo; said Lamme; &ldquo;I
would fain run through the whole town, and I will find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not find her, since she is hiding from you,&rdquo;
said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Lamme asked for explanations from the <i>baes</i>, but the other
would tell him nothing.</p>
<p>And they went away towards Damme.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>While they went on their way, Ulenspiegel said to Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not tell me how you found her beside you, last
night, and how she left you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; replied Lamme, &ldquo;you know that we had
feasted on meat, on beer, on wine, and that I could hardly breathe when
we went off to bed. I held a wax candle in my hand, like a lord, to
light me and had put down the candlestick on a chest to sleep; the door
had remained ajar, the chest was close to it. Undressing, I looked on
my bed with great love and desire for sleep; the wax candle suddenly
went out. I heard as it were a breath and a sound of light feet in my
chamber; but being more sleepy than afraid, I lay down heavily. As I
was about to fall asleep, a voice&mdash;her voice, O my wife, my poor
wife!&mdash;said to me: &lsquo;Have you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>supped well,
Lamme?&rsquo; and her voice was beside me, and her face, too, and her
sweet body.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">On that day Philip the king, having eaten too much
pastry, was more melancholy than usual. He had played upon his living
harpsichord, which was a case containing cats whose heads came out
through round openings above the keys. Every time the king struck a
key, the key in turn struck a cat with a dart, and the beast mewed and
complained by reason of the pain.</p>
<p>But Philip never laughed.</p>
<p>Unceasingly, he sought in his mind how he could conquer the great
queen, Elizabeth, and set up Mary Stuart on the throne of England. With
this object he had written to the Pope who was needy and full of debts;
the Pope had replied that for this enterprise he would gladly sell the
holy vessels of the temples and the treasures of the Vatican.</p>
<p>But Philip never laughed.</p>
<p>Ridolfi, Queen Mary&rsquo;s favourite, who hoped, by delivering her,
to marry her afterwards and become king of England, came to see Philip
and with him plot the murder of Elizabeth. But he was so
&ldquo;parlanchin,&rdquo; as the king wrote, so given to talking, that
his designs were openly talked about in the Antwerp Bourse; and the
murder was never committed.</p>
<p>And Philip never laughed.</p>
<p>Later, in accordance with the king&rsquo;s orders, the bloody duke
sent two couples of assassins into England. They succeeded in getting
hanged.</p>
<p>And Philip never laughed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>And thus God brought to naught and thwarted the ambition of this
vampire, who looked to remove her son from Mary Stuart and to reign in
his stead, with the Pope, over England. And the murderer was irritated
to see this noble country so great and powerful. He never ceased to
turn his pale eyes towards it, seeking how he might crush it so as to
reign thereafter over the whole world, exterminate the reformers, and
especially the rich, and inherit the victim&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p>But he never laughed.</p>
<p>And mice and field mice were brought to him in an iron box, with
high sides, and open of one side; and he put the bottom of the box on a
hot fire and took his pleasure in seeing and hearing the poor little
beasts leaping, moaning, and dying.</p>
<p>But he never laughed.</p>
<p>Then pale and with trembling hand he went to the arms of Madame
d&rsquo;Eboli, to slake the fire of his lust lit by the torch of
cruelty.</p>
<p>And he never laughed.</p>
<p>And Madame d&rsquo;Eboli received him for fear and not for love.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The air was warm: from the quiet sea there came not a
breath of wind. Scarce did the trees by the canal of Damme shiver, the
grasshoppers dwelt in the meadows, while in the fields men from the
churches and the abbeys came to fetch the thirteenth part of the
harvest for the cur&eacute;s and the abbots. Out of the sky, blue,
ardent, deep, the sun poured down warmth and Nature slept under his
rays like a fair girl naked and swooning under her lover&rsquo;s
caresses. The carps were cutting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172"
href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>capers above the surface of
the canal to seize the flies that buzzed like a kettle; while the
swallows, with their long bodies and great wings, disputed the prey
with them. From the earth rose a warm vapour, wavering and shimmering
in the light. The beadle of Damme announced from the top of the tower,
by means of a cracked bell sounding like a pot, that it was noon and
time for the country folk working at the haymaking to go to dinner.
Women cried long and loud, holding their closed hands funnel-wise,
calling in their men, brothers or husbands, by name: Hans, Pieter,
Joos; and one might see their red hoods above the hedges.</p>
<p>Far off, in the eyes of Lamme and Ulenspiegel, rose lofty, square,
and massive the tower of Notre Dame, and Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my son, are thy griefs and thy love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;shall I see my ancient home
and perchance my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man of wood,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;heart of stone,
nothing then can affect you, neither the nearness of the places in
which you spent your boyhood, nor the dear shades of poor Claes and
poor Soetkin, the two martyrs. What! you are neither sad nor glad; what
then hath dried up your heart in this way? Look at me, anxious, uneasy,
bounding in my belly; look at me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme looked at Ulenspiegel and saw him with head livid, pale and
hanging, his lips trembling, and weeping without saying a word.</p>
<p>And he held his tongue.</p>
<p>They marched thus in silence as far as Damme, and came into it by
the street of the Heron, and saw no one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>in it, because of the
heat. The dogs, with their tongues hanging out, lying on their sides,
were gaping before the thresholds of the doors. Lamme and Ulenspiegel
passed directly in front of the Townhall, before which Claes had been
burned; the lips of Ulenspiegel trembled more, and his tears dried up.
Finding himself over against the house of Claes, occupied by a coalman,
he said to him as he went within:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou know me? I am fain to rest here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master coalman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know thee; thou art the son of the victim. Go wherever thou
wouldst in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went into the kitchen, then into the bedchamber of Claes
and Soetkin, and there he wept.</p>
<p>When he had come down thence, the master coalman said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are bread, cheese, and beer. If thou art hungry, eat; if
thou art thirsty, drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel signed with his hand that he was neither hungry nor
thirsty.</p>
<p>He walked thus with Lamme, who stayed astraddle on his ass, while
Ulenspiegel held his by the halter.</p>
<p>They arrived at Katheline&rsquo;s cottage, tied up their asses, and
went in. It was meal time. There were on the table haricots in their
pods mixed with great white beans. Katheline was eating; Nele was
standing and ready to pour into Katheline&rsquo;s plate a vinegar sauce
she had just taken from the fire.</p>
<p>When Ulenspiegel came in, she was so startled that she put the pot
and all the sauce in Katheline&rsquo;s plate, who, nodding her head,
began to hunt for the beans around the saucepot with her spoon, and
striking herself on the forehead, repeated like a madwoman:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Take away the fire! My head is burning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smell of the vinegar made Lamme hungry.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel remained standing, looking at Nele, smiling with love
through his great sadness.</p>
<p>And Nele, without a word, threw her arms about his neck. She, too,
seemed bereft of her wits; she wept, laughed; and red with great and
sweet joy, she said only: &ldquo;Thyl! Thyl!&rdquo; Ulenspiegel, happy,
gazed at her; then she left him, went and stationed herself farther
off, contemplated him with joy and from there once again sprang upon
him, throwing her arms about his neck; and so several times over. He
held her, very happy, unable to sever from her, until she fell upon a
chair, wearied out and as though out of her senses; and she said
without any shame:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thyl! Thyl! my beloved, and so there you are back
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme was standing at the door; when Nele was calmed, she said,
pointing to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have I seen this big man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my friend,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;He is
seeking for his wife in my company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know thee,&rdquo; said Nele, speaking to Lamme; &ldquo;thou
didst use to dwell in the street of the Heron. Thou art seeking thy
wife; I saw her at Bruges, living in all piety and devoutness. Having
asked her why she had so cruelly abandoned her husband, she answered
me: &lsquo;Such was the holy will of God and the order of the holy
Penance, but I cannot live with him henceforth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme was sad at this word, and looked at the beans in vinegar. And
the larks, singing, sprang aloft in the sky, and Nature in ecstasy
allowed herself to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>caressed by the sun. And Katheline
with her spoon picked out all round the pot the white beans, the green
pods, and the sauce.</p>

<h2 id="xd20e4768" class="main">XLIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this time a girl of fifteen went from Heyst to
Knokke, alone, in broad daylight, through the dunes. No one had any
fears for her, for it was well known that weer-wolves and evil spirits
of the damned bite only by night. She was carrying in a pouch
forty-eight sols in silver, of the value of four florins carolus, which
her mother Toria Pieterson, who lived at Heyst, owed, out of the
proceeds of a sale, to her uncle, Jan Rapen, who lived at Knokke. The
girl, by name Betkin, having donned all her best finery, had gone off
gaily.</p>
<p>That night her mother was uneasy not to see her come home; still,
thinking she had slept at her uncle&rsquo;s house, she reassured
herself.</p>
<p>The next day certain fishermen, coming back from sea with a boat
full of fish, hauled their boat up on the beach and unloaded their fish
into carts, to sell it by auction, cart by cart, in Heyst. They climbed
up the road, strewn with broken shells, and found among the dunes a
young girl stripped quite naked, even of her chemise, and blood around
her. Coming near, they saw in her poor broken neck the marks of long,
sharp teeth. Lying on her back, her eyes were open, staring at the sky,
and her mouth was open, too, as if to cry out on death!</p>
<p>Covering the girl&rsquo;s body with an <i lang=
"nl">opperst-kleed</i>, they brought it to Heyst, to the Townhall.
Thither speedily assembled the aldermen and the barber-surgeon, who
declared that those long teeth were never wolf&rsquo;s teeth as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>they were made by Nature, but belonged to some
wicked and evil and infernal <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>, and that it
behoved all men to pray to God to deliver the land of Flanders.</p>
<p>And in all the country and especially at Damme, Heyst, and Knokke,
were ordained prayers and orisons.</p>
<p>And the people, groaning, remained in the churches.</p>
<p>In the church of Heyst, where the corpse of the young girl was laid
out and exposed, men and women wept, seeing her neck all bloody and
torn. And the mother said in the very church:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i> and kill him with
my teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the women, weeping, egged her on to do this. And some said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went, with her husband and her two brothers well armed, to
hunt for the wolf by beach, dune, and valley, but never found him. And
her husband was obliged to take her home, for she had caught fever by
reason of the night cold; and they watched beside her, mending their
nets for the next fishing day.</p>
<p>The bailiff of Damme, bethinking himself that the <i lang=
"nl">weer-wolf</i> is a beast that lives on blood and does not strip
the dead, said that this one was doubtless followed by robbers
wandering about the dunes seeking their evil gain. Wherefore he
summoned by the sound of the church bell all and sundry, directing them
to fall well armed and furnished with cudgels upon all beggars and
tramping ruffians, to apprehend their persons and search them to see if
they might not have in their satchels gold carolus or any portion of
the victim&rsquo;s raiment. And after this the able-bodied beggars and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>tramps should be taken to the king&rsquo;s
galleys. And the aged and infirm should be allowed to go their
ways.</p>
<p>But they found nothing.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went to the bailiff&rsquo;s and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to slay the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gives thee this confidence?&rdquo; asked the
bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;Grant me permission to work in the forge of the
commune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou mayst do so,&rdquo; said the bailiff.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, without saying a word of his project to any man or
woman in Damme, went off to the forge and there in secret he fashioned
a fine and large-sized engine to trap wild beasts.</p>
<p>The next day, being Saturday, a day beloved of the <i lang=
"nl">weer-wolf</i>, Ulenspiegel, carrying a letter from the bailiff for
the cur&eacute; of Heyst, and the engine under his cloak, armed also
with a good crossbow and a well-sharpened cutlass, departed, saying to
the folk in Damme<span class="corr" id="xd20e4833" title=
"Source: .">:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to shoot sea-mews and I will make pillows for the
bailiff&rsquo;s wife with their down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going towards Heyst, he came upon the beach, heard the boisterous
sea curling and breaking in big waves, roaring like thunder, and the
wind came from England whistling in the rigging of shipwrecked boats. A
fisherman said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is ruin to us, this ill wind. Last night the sea was
still, but after sunrise it got up suddenly into fury. We shall not be
able to go a-fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was glad, assured thus of having help during the night
if there should be need.</p>
<p>At Heyst he went to the cur&eacute;, and gave him the letter from
the bailiff. The cur&eacute; said to him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art bold: yet know that no man passes alone at night, by
the dunes, on Saturday without being bitten and left dead on the sand.
The workmen on the dykes and others go there only in bands. Night is
falling. Dost thou hear the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i> howling in his
valley? Will he come again as he did this last night, to cry terribly
in the graveyard the whole night long? God be with thee, my son, but go
not thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cur&eacute; crossed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since thou hast so stout a mind, I will help thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master cur&eacute;,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;you would
do a great boon to me and to the poor desolated country by going to the
house of Toria, the mother of the slain girl, and to her two brothers
likewise to tell them that the wolf is close at hand, and that I mean
to await and kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou dost not yet know on what path thou shouldst take up
thy stand, stay in that one that leads to the graveyard. It is between
two hedges of broom. Two men could not walk in it side by
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take my stand there,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;And do you, valiant master cur&eacute;, co-worker of
deliverance, order and enjoin the girl&rsquo;s mother, with her husband
and her brothers, to be in the church, all armed, before the curfew. If
they hear me whistling like the sea-mew, it will mean that I have seen
the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>. They must then sound <i>wacharm</i> on
the bell and come to my rescue. And if there are any other brave
men?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are none, my son,&rdquo; replied the cur&eacute;.
&ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>fishermen fear the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>
more than the plague and death. But go not thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; said then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do as thou wishest; be thou blessed. Art thou hungry
or thirsty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; gave him beer, bread, and cheese.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel drank, ate, and went away.</p>
<p>Going along and raising his eyes, he saw his father Claes in glory,
by the side of God, in the sky where the clear moon was shining, and
looked at the sea and the clouds and he heard the tempestuous wind
blowing out of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;black clouds that pass so swift,
be ye like Vengeance upon the heels of Murder. Roaring sea, sky that
dost make thee black as the mouth of hell, waves with the fire foam
running along the sombre water, shaking impatient, wrathful, ye animals
innumerable of fire, oxen, sheep, horses, serpents that wallow upon the
sea or rise up into the air, belching out a flaming rain, O sea all
black, sky black with mourning, come with me to fight against the
<i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>, the foul murderer of little girls. And
thou, wind that wailest plaintively in the bents on the dunes and in
the cordage of the ships, thou art the voice of the victims crying out
for vengeance to God; may He be my helper in this
enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went down into the valley, tottering on his two natural posts
as if he had had the drunkard&rsquo;s wine-lees in his head and a
cabbage-indigestion on his stomach. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>And he sang hiccuping, zigzagging, yawning, spitting, and stopping,
playing at a pretence of vomiting, but in reality opening his eyes wide
to study closely everything about him, when suddenly he heard a shrill
howling; he stopped short, vomiting like a dog, and saw in the light of
the strong shining moon the long shape of a wolf walking towards the
cemetery.</p>
<p>Tottering again he entered on the path marked out among the broom.
There, feigning to fall, he set the engine on the side whence the wolf
was coming, made ready his crossbow, and moved away ten paces, standing
in a drunken attitude, continually pretending to stagger about, to
hiccup and vomit, but in verity stringing up his wits like a bow and
keeping eyes and ears wide open.</p>
<p>And he saw nothing, nothing but the black clouds running like mad
things over the sky and a large thick and short shape coming towards
him; and he heard nothing but the wind wailing plaintively, the sea
roaring like thunder, and the shell-strewn road crackling under a
heavy, stumbling tread.</p>
<p>Feigning to want to sit down, he fell on the road like a drunkard,
heavily. And he spat.</p>
<p>Then he heard as it were iron clicking two paces from his ear, then
the noise of his engine shutting up and a man&rsquo;s cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has
his front paws taken in the trap. He gets up howling, shaking the
engine, trying to run. But he will never escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he sped a crossbow dart into his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he falls, wounded,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And he whistled like a sea-mew.</p>
<p>Suddenly the church bell rang out the <i>wacharm</i>, a shrill
lad&rsquo;s voice cried through the village: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Awake, ye sleeping folk, the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i> is
caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Toria, Betkin&rsquo;s mother, Lansaem her husband, Josse and Michiel
her brothers, came the first with their lanterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is taken?&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him on the roadway,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>And they made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that ringing?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Lansaem replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eldest boy; the youngest is running through the village
knocking at the doors and crying that the wolf is taken. Praise be to
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Suddenly the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i> spake and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity upon me, pity, Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wolf talks,&rdquo; said they, crossing themselves.
&ldquo;He is a devil and he knows Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s name
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity, pity,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;bid the bell
be quiet; it is ringing for the dead; pity, I am no wolf. My wrists are
pierced by the engine; I am old and I bleed; pity! What is this shrill
boy&rsquo;s voice awaking the village? Pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard thy voice of old,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel,
vehemently. &ldquo;Thou art the fishmonger, the murderer of Claes, the
vampire of the poor little young girls. Men and women, have no fear.
&rsquo;Tis the demon, he through whom Soetkin died for grief and
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And holding him by the neck beneath the chin with one hand, with the
other he drew his cutlass.</p>
<p>But Toria, Betkin&rsquo;s mother, stayed him in this movement.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him alive,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>And she plucked out his white hairs by handfuls, and tore his face
with her nails.</p>
<p>And she howled with grief and fury.</p>
<p>The <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i>, his hands fast in the engine and
stumbling about the roadway, through his keen sufferings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pity! take this woman away. I
will give two carolus. Break those bells! Where are those children that
are calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him alive!&rdquo; cried Toria, &ldquo;keep him alive,
let him pay! The bells for the dead, the death bells for thee,
murderer. By slow fire, by red-hot pincers. Keep him alive! let him
pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Toria had picked up on the road a waffle iron with long
arms. Looking closely at it in the light of the torches, she saw it
deeply engraved between the two iron plates with lozenges in the
Brabant fashion, but armed besides, like an iron mouth, with long sharp
teeth. And when she opened it, it was like the mouth of a
greyhound.</p>
<p>Then Toria, holding the waffle iron, opening it and shutting it and
making the iron ring, seemed as though she had lost her wits for male
fury, and gnashing her teeth and with hoarse rattle breath like a woman
dying, bit the prisoner with this engine in the arms, the legs,
everywhere, seeking most of all his neck, and with every bite
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus he did to Betkin with the iron teeth. He pays. Dost thou
bleed, murderer? God is just. The bells for the dead! Betkin is calling
me to revenge. Dost thou feel the teeth? &rsquo;Tis the mouth of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she bit him without ceasing and without pity, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>striking him with the waffle iron when she could
not bite him with it. And because of her great thirst for revenge she
did not kill him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show compassion,&rdquo; cried the prisoner.
&ldquo;Ulenspiegel, strike me with thy knife, I shall die quicker. Take
this woman away. Break the bells for the dead; kill those calling
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Toria still kept biting him, until an old man, in pity, took the
waffle iron out of her hands.</p>
<p>But Toria then spat on the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf&rsquo;s</i> face
and tore out his hairs, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt pay, by slow fire, by burning pincers, thy eyes to
my nails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime were come all the fishermen, rustics, and women of
Heyst, at the report that the <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i> was a man and
not a devil. Some carried lanterns and flaming torches. And all were
crying out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robber and murderer, where dost thou hide the gold stolen
from the poor victims? Let him give all back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none: have pity,&rdquo; said the fishmonger.</p>
<p>And the women threw stones and sand upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pays, he pays!&rdquo; cried Toria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;I am all wet with my own
blood running. Pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy blood?&rdquo; said Toria. &ldquo;There will be enough
left for thee to pay with. Cover his wounds with ointment. He will pay
by the slow fire, his hand cut off, with red-hot pincers. He shall pay,
he shall pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she would have struck him; then out of her senses she fell upon
the sand as though dead, and she was left there till she came back to
herself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ulenspiegel, taking the prisoner&rsquo;s hands
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>out of the engine, saw that there were three
fingers lacking on the right hand.</p>
<p>And he gave orders to bind him straitly and to put him in a
fisherman&rsquo;s hamper. Men, women, and children then departed,
taking turns to carry the hamper, wending their way towards Damme to
seek justice there. And they carried torches and lanterns.</p>
<p>And the fishmonger kept repeating without ceasing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break the bells; kill the children that are
calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Toria said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him pay, by slow fire, by red-hot pincers, let him
pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both held their peace. And Ulenspiegel heard no more, save the
laboured breathing of Toria, the heavy steps of the men on the sand,
and the sea roaring like thunder.</p>
<p>And sad in his heart, he looked at the clouds running like mad
things in the sky, the sea where the sheep of fire were to be seen, and
in the light of the torches and the lanterns the livid face of the
fishmonger staring on him with cruel eyes.</p>
<p>And the ashes beat upon his heart.</p>
<p>And they marched for four hours till they came to where was the
populace assembled in one mass, knowing the news already. All wishing
to see the fishmonger, they followed the band of fishermen shouting,
singing, dancing, and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i lang="nl">weer-wolf</i> is taken! he is taken, the
murderer! Blessed be Ulenspiegel! Long life to our brother Ulenspiegel!
<i lang="nl">Lange leven onsen broeder Ulenspiegel.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was like a revolt of the people.</p>
<p>When they passed before the bailiff&rsquo;s house, he came out at
the noise and said to Ulenspiegel: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art the victor; praise be to thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes of Claes were beating upon my heart,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The bailiff then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt have the half of the murderer&rsquo;s
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to the victims,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Lamme and Nele came; Nele, laughing and weeping for gladness, kissed
her friend Ulenspiegel; Lamme, jumping heavily, smote him on the
stomach, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a brave, a trusty, a faithful one; &rsquo;tis my
beloved companion; ye have none such, ye others, ye folk of the flat
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fishermen laughed, mocking at him.</p>

<p class="first">The bell called <i>Borgstrom</i> rang next day to
summon the bailiff, aldermen, and clerks of the court to the
<i>Vierschare</i> on the four turf benches, under the tree of justice,
which was a noble lime tree. All around were the common folk. Being
interrogated the fishmonger would confess nothing, even when he was
shown the three fingers severed by the soldier, and missing from his
right hand. He kept saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am poor and old; have compassion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the common folk hooted him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art an old wolf, a child killer; do not have pity on
him, judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look not on us with thy cold eyes; thou art a man and not a
devil; we do not fear thee. Cruel beast, more coward than a cat
devouring small birds in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=

girls asking to live their pretty little lives in all
honesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him pay by slow fire, by red-hot pincers,&rdquo; cried
Toria.</p>
<p>And in spite of the sergeants of the commune, the mothers egged on
the lads to throw stones at the fishmonger. And the boys did so
eagerly, hooting him every time he looked at them and crying
incessantly: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">Blood-zuyger</i>, blood-sucker!
<i lang="nl">Sla dood</i>, kill, kill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Toria cried without ceasing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him pay by slow fire; by red-hot pincers let him
pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the populace growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the women among each other, &ldquo;how cold
he is under the sun that shines in the sky, warming his white hairs and
his face torn by Toria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he shivers with pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the justice of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he stands there with a lamentable air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See his murderer&rsquo;s hands tied before him and bleeding
from the wounds of the trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him pay, let him pay!&rdquo; cried Toria.</p>
<p>He said, bemoaning himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am poor, let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And everyone, nay, even the judges, mocked as they listened to him.
He wept feigningly, meaning to touch their hearts. And the women
laughed.</p>
<p>The evidence being sufficient to warrant torture, he was condemned
to be put on the bench until he had confessed how he killed, whence he
came, where were the spoils of the victims, and the place where he had
his gold hidden.</p>
<p>Being in the torture chamber, and shod with foot-gear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>of
new leather too small for him, and the bailiff asking him how Satan had
come to suggest to him such black designs and crimes so abominable, he
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satan is myself, my natural being. Already when a small boy,
but ugly to look on, unfit for all bodily exercise, I was held a ninny
by everybody and often beaten. Lad nor lass had pity never. In my
adolescence no women would have me, not even though I paid. Then I put
on cold hatred against every being born of a woman. That was why I
denounced Claes, beloved of all. And I loved but Money only, that was
my darling, white or golden; to have Claes killed I found both profit
and pleasure. After I must live like a wolf more than ever, and I
dreamed of biting. Passing through Brabant, I saw there the waffle
irons of that country and thought that one of them would be a good iron
mouth for me. Why do not I have you by the neck, you evil tigers, that
delight in an old man&rsquo;s torment! I would bite you with greater
joy than the soldier and the little girl. For her, when I saw her so
sweet, sleeping on the sand in the sun, holding the little bag of money
in her hands, I felt love and pity; feeling myself too old and not
being able to take her, I bit her....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff asking him where he lived, the fishmonger replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Ramskapelle, whence I go to Blanckenberghe, to Heyst, even
as far as Knokke. On Sundays and feast days, I make waffles, after the
fashion of those of Brabant, in all the villages with yonder machine.
It is always very clean and well oiled. And this novelty of foreign
parts was well received. If you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>should please to know more,
and how it was that no one could recognize me, I will tell you that by
day I reddened my face with rouge and painted my hair red. As for the
wolf skin you are pointing to with your cruel finger, questioning me, I
will tell you, defying you, that it comes from two wolves killed by me
in the woods of Raveschoot and of Maldeghen. I had but to sew the skins
together to cover myself with them. I hid it in a box in the dunes of
Heyst; there are also the clothes stolen by me to sell later at a fit
opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him from before the fire,&rdquo; said the bailiff. The
tormentor obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is thy gold?&rdquo; said the bailiff again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king shall never know,&rdquo; replied the fishmonger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn him with the candles nearer him,&rdquo; said the
bailiff. &ldquo;Put him closer to the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tormentor obeyed and the fishmonger cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say nothing. I have spoken too much; ye will burn me.
I am no sorcerer; why do ye set me at the fire again? My feet are
bleeding from the burns. I will say nothing. Why nearer now? They
bleed, I tell you, they bleed; these slippers are boots of red-hot
iron. My gold? Ah, well, my only friend in this world, it is ... take
me away from the fire; it is in my cave at Ramskapelle, in a box ...
leave it to me; grace and mercy, master judges; cursed tormentor, take
the candles away.... He burns me more ... it is in a box with a false
bottom wrapped in wool, so as to avoid a noise if any one shakes the
box; now I have told all; take me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was taken away from before the fire, he smiled
maliciously.</p>
<p>The bailiff asked him why. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for comfort at being eased,&rdquo; replied he.</p>
<p>The bailiff said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did no one ever ask thee to let him see thy toothed waffle
iron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishmonger replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was seen like any other, save that it is pierced with
holes in which I was wont to screw the iron teeth at dawn I took them
out; the <span class="corr" id="xd20e5191" title=
"Source: peasant sprefer">peasants prefer</span> my waffles to those of
the other sellers; and they call them &lsquo;<i lang="nl">Waefels met
brabandsche knoopen</i>&rsquo;, &lsquo;waffles with brabant
buttons&rsquo;, because when the teeth are away, the empty holes make
little half spheres like buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bailiff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When didst thou bite the poor victims?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By day and by night. By day I used to wander about the dunes
and the highways, carrying my waffle iron, keeping in hiding, and
especially on Saturday, the day of the great Bruges market. If I saw
some rustic pass, wandering melancholy, I left him alone, judging that
his trouble was a flux of the purse; but I used to walk along by him
whom I saw journeying merrily; when he did not look for it I would bite
him in the neck and take his satchel. And not only in the dunes, but on
all the byways and highways of the flat country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repent and pray unto God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Lord God that willed I should be what I am. I did
all without my will, egged on by Nature&rsquo;s will. Wicked tigers, ye
will punish me unjustly. But do not burn me ... I did all without my
will; have pity, I am poor and old; I shall die of my wounds; do not
burn me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>He was then taken to the <i>Vierschare</i>, under the lime tree,
there to hear his sentence in the presence of all the people
assembled.</p>
<p>And he was condemned, as a horrible murderer, robber, and
blasphemer, to have his tongue pierced with a red-hot iron, his right
hand cut off, and to be burned alive in a slow fire, until death
ensued, before the doors of the Townhall.</p>
<p>And Toria cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just; he pays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the people cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="nl">Lang leven de Heeren van de Wet</i>,&rdquo; long
life to the men of the law.</p>
<p>He was taken back into prison, where he was given meat and wine. And
he was merry, saying that he had never till then eaten or drunk,
either, but that the king, inheriting his goods, could well pay for his
last meal for him.</p>
<p>And he laughed sourly.</p>
<p>The next day, at the first of dawn, while they were taking him to
execution, he saw Ulenspiegel standing beside the stake, and he cried
out, pointing to him with his finger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one there, murderer of an old man, ought to die as well;
he flung me into the canal of Damme, ten years ago, because I had
denounced his father, wherein I had served His Catholic Majesty as a
faithful subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bells of Notre Dame rang for the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thee even as for me are those bells tolling,&rdquo; said
he to Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;thou shalt be hanged, for thou hast
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fishmonger lies,&rdquo; cried all the common folk;
&ldquo;he lies, the murdering ruffian.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Toria, like a madwoman, cried out, flinging a stone at him that
cut his forehead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had drowned thee, thou wouldst not have lived to bite
my poor girl, like a bloodsucking vampire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ulenspiegel uttered no word, Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any see him throw the fishmonger in the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; shouted the people; &ldquo;he lied, the
murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I lied not,&rdquo; cried the fishmonger, &ldquo;he threw
me in, while I implored him to forgive me, and by the same token, I got
out by the help of a skiff tied up alongside the high bank. Wet through
and shivering, I could scarcely get back to my poor home. I had the
fever then, none looked after me, and I deemed I must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou liest,&rdquo; said Lamme; &ldquo;no man saw
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no man saw it,&rdquo; cried Toria. &ldquo;To the fire
with the murderer. Before he dies he wants an innocent victim; let him
pay! He has lied. If thou didst do it, confess not, Ulenspiegel. There
are no witnesses. Let him pay by slow fire, by red-hot
pincers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didst thou commit the murder?&rdquo; the bailiff asked
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flung the murderer, the denouncer of Claes, into the water.
My father&rsquo;s ashes were beating on my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He confesseth,&rdquo; said the fishmonger; &ldquo;he shall
die even as I. Where is the gallows, that I may see it? Where is the
executioner with the sword of justice? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>The death bells are
ringing for thee, rascal, murderer of an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I threw thee into the water to kill thee; the ashes were
beating on my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And among the people, the women said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why confess it, Ulenspiegel? No man saw it, now thou shalt
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the prisoner laughed, leaping for bitter joy, waving his arms
that were tied and covered with blood-stained wrappings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will die,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he will pass from earth
into hell, the rope about his neck, as a ragamuffin, a robber, a
rascal: he will die, God is just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall not die,&rdquo; said the bailiff. &ldquo;After ten
years, murder may not be punished in the soil of Flanders. Ulenspiegel
committed a bad action, but through filial love: Ulenspiegel will not
be prosecuted for this deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the law!&rdquo; cried the people. &ldquo;<i lang=
"nl">Lang leven de Wet.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bells of Notre Dame rang for the dead. And the prisoner gnashed
his teeth, drooped his head, and wept his first tear.</p>
<p>And he had his hand cut off, and his tongue pierced with a hot iron,
and he was burned alive by a slow fire before the doorway of the
Townhall.</p>
<p>At the point of death he yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king shall not have my gold; I lied.... Evil tigers, I
will come back to bite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Toria cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pays, he pays! They writhe and twist, the arms and the
legs that ran to murder: it smokes, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>murderer&rsquo;s
body; his white hair, hy&aelig;na&rsquo;s hair, burns on his pale face.
He pays! He pays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the fishmonger died, howling like a wolf.</p>
<p>And the bells of Notre Dame tolled for the dead.</p>
<p>And Lamme and Ulenspiegel mounted upon their asses again.</p>
<p>And Nele, sad and grieving, dwelt with Katheline, who said, without
ceasing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take away the fire! my head is burning; come back, Hanske, my
darling.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195"

<p class="first">Being at Heyst, upon the dunes, Ulenspiegel and Lamme
see, coming from Ostend, from Blanckenberghe, from Knokke, many fishing
boats full of armed men, adherents of the Beggars of Zealand, who wear
in their headgear the silver crescent with this inscription:
&ldquo;Better to serve the Turk than the Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel is glad; he whistles like the lark; from all sides
answers the warlike clarion of the cock.</p>
<p>The boats, sailing or fishing and selling their fish, come to land,
one after the other, at Emden. There William of Blois is detained, who
is equipping a ship under commission from the Prince of Orange.</p>
<p>Tr&egrave;s-Long, having been at Emden for eleven weeks, was
bitterly sick of waiting. He went from his ship to land and from the
land to his ship, like a bear on a chain.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Lamme, wandering about on the quays, saw there a
lord of a jovial visage, somewhat melancholy and at a loss to heave up
one of the paving-stones of the quay with a pikestaff. Not succeeding
in this he still bent every effort to carry out his undertaking, while
a dog gnawed at a bone behind him.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel came to the dog and pretended to want to rob him of his
bone. The dog growls; Ulenspiegel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>does not stop: the dog makes
a great uproar of doggish wrath.</p>
<p>The lord, turning at the noise, said to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good does it do thee to torment this beast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good does it do you, Messire, to torment this
pavement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the same thing at all,&rdquo; said the lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difference is not extreme,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel;
&ldquo;if the dog sets store by his bone and wants to keep it, this
pavement holds to its quay and is fain to remain on it. And it is the
very least that folk like us may do, turning to busy ourselves about a
dog when folk like you busy yourselves about a paving stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamme remained behind Ulenspiegel, not daring to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked the lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Thyl Ulenspiegel, the son of Claes, who died in the
flames for his faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he whistled like the lark and the lord crowed like the cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Admiral Tr&egrave;s-Long,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what
wouldst thou with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel narrated to him his adventures, and gave him five
hundred carolus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this big man?&rdquo; asked Tr&egrave;s-Long, pointing
a finger at Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My comrade and friend,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel: &ldquo;he
desires, like myself, to sing on your ship, with the fine voice of a
musket, the song of deliverance for the land of our fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are brave men both,&rdquo; said Tr&egrave;s-Long,
&ldquo;and ye shall go on my ship.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>They were then in the month of February; sharp was the wind, keen
the frost. After three weeks of grudging waiting Tr&egrave;s-Long left
Emden under protest. Thinking to enter the Texel, he went out from
Vlie, but was forced to go in to Wieringen, where his ship was locked
up in the ice.</p>
<p>Soon there was a merry spectacle all about: sledges and skaters all
in velvet; women skating in jackets and skirts broidered with gold,
pearl, scarlet, azure; lads and lasses went, came, glided, laughed,
following one another in line, or two by two, in pairs, singing the
song of love upon the ice, or going to eat and drink in booths decked
out with flags, brandy, oranges, figs, <i lang="nl">peperkoek</i>,
<i lang="nl">schols</i>, eggs, hot vegetables, and <i lang=
"nl">eete-koeken</i>, which are pancakes and pickled vegetables, while
all about them sleds and sailing sleighs made the ice cry out under
their runners.</p>
<p>Lamme, seeking his wife, went wandering on skates like the jolly men
and women, but he fell often.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ulenspiegel went to drink and to feed in a small inn on
the quay where he had not to pay too dear for his daily rations; and he
liked to talk with the old <i lang="nl">baesine</i>.</p>
<p>One Sunday about nine he went in there asking them to give him his
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he to a pretty woman coming forward to serve
him, &ldquo;<i lang="nl">baesine</i> rejuvenated, what hast thou done
with thy old wrinkles? Thy mouth hath all its teeth, white and girlish,
and its lips are red as cherries. Is it for me, that soft and cunning
smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but what must I give
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thyself,&rdquo; said he. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200"
href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>The woman answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be too much for a starveling like you; would you
not like other meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel making no reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with that
handsome, well-made, corpulent man whom I often saw with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with him?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He eats, in the booths, hard eggs, smoked eels, salt fish,
<i lang="nl">zuertjes</i>, and all that he can put under his tooth; and
all to look for his wife. Why art thou not his wife, pretty one?
Wouldst thou like fifty florins? Wouldst thou like a gold
necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she, crossing herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not to buy or to take,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou love naught?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love thee as my neighbour, but I love above all my Lord
Christ and Madame the Virgin, who bid me live a chaste life. Hard and
heavy are its duties, but God is our helper, we poor women. Yet there
are some that succumb. Is thy big friend happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gay when he is eating, sad when fasting, and always
pensive. But thou, art thou happy or sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We women,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;are slaves of that that
rules us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to tell Lamme to come to see thee.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not so,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he would weep and I in
likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didst thou ever see his wife?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Sighing, she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sinned with him and was condemned to a cruel penance. She
knows that he goeth on the sea for the triumph of heresy, and that is a
hard thing for a Christian heart to think on. Defend him if he is
attacked; care for him if he is wounded: his wife bade me make this
request of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme is my brother and my friend,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why do ye not return to the bosom
of our Mother Holy Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She devours her children,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And he went his way.</p>
<p>One morning in March, since the wind, that was blowing sharp and
cutting, ceased not to thicken the ice, and Tr&egrave;s-Long&rsquo;s
ship could not leave, the sailors and the soldiers of the vessel were
holding feasting and revel on sledges and on skates.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was at the inn, and the pretty woman said to him, all
woeful and as if bereft of her wits:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Lamme! poor Ulenspiegel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you lament?&rdquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;why do ye not believe in
the mass. Ye would go to paradise, without a doubt, and I could save
you in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing her go to the door and listen attentively, Ulenspiegel said
to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the snow falling that you are listening
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202"
href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the moaning wind that you give ear to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to the merry din that our valiant sailors are making in
the tavern close by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death cometh as a thief,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;I do not understand
thee; come inside and speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The soldiers of Simonen-Bol,
who are to come, in the name of the duke, to throw themselves on all of
you; if you are so well treated here, it is like the bullocks that are
meant for the slaughter. Ah! why,&rdquo; said she all in tears,
&ldquo;why did I not know it save but just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not weep, nor cry out,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and
stay where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not betray me,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went out from her house, ran, made his way to all the
booths and taverns, whispering into the ears of the seamen and the
soldiers these words: &ldquo;The Spaniard is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All ran to the ship, preparing with the utmost haste all that was
needed for battle, and they awaited the enemy. Ulenspiegel said to
Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seest thou yon pretty woman standing upon the quay, with her
black dress embroidered with scarlet, and hiding her face under her
white hood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all one to me,&rdquo; replied Lamme. &ldquo;I am cold;
I want to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he rolled his head up in his <i lang="nl">opperst-kleed</i>. And
like that he was as a man deaf. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then recognized the woman and called to her from the
ship:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou wish to follow us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the grave,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I
cannot....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wouldst do well,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;yet
think of this: when the nightingale stays in the forest, it is happy
and sings; but if it leaves the forest and risks its little wings in
the wind of the great sea, it breaks them and dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sung in my house,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and would
sing outside if I could.&rdquo; Then drawing closer to the ship:
&ldquo;Take this ointment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for thyself and thy
friend who sleeps when he should wake....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went away saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme! Lamme! God keep thee from harm; come back
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she uncovered her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, my wife!&rdquo; cried Lamme.</p>
<p>And he would have leaped down on the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy faithful wife!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>And she ran away swiftly.</p>
<p>Lamme would have leaped from off the deck down on the ice, but he
was prevented by a soldier, who held him back by his <i lang=
"nl">opperst-kleed</i>. He cried, wept, implored that he might be given
leave to go. But the provost said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt be hanged if thou dost leave the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Lamme would have cast himself on the ice, but an old Beggar
held him back, saying to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The floor is damp, you might get your feet wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme fell on his behind, weeping and saying without ceasing:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, my wife! let me go to my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt see her again,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;She
loves thee, but she loves God more than thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mad she-devil,&rdquo; cried Lamme. &ldquo;If she loves
God more than her husband, why does she show herself to me lovely and
desirable? And if she loves me, why does she leave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou see clear in a deep well?&rdquo; asked
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I shall die before
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he stayed upon the deck, livid and distraught.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, had come up the men of Simonen-Bol, with a great
artillery.</p>
<p>They fired against the ship, which replied to them. And their cannon
balls broke the ice all about it. Towards evening a warm rain fell.</p>
<p>The wind blowing from the west, the sea grew angry under the ice,
and heaved it up in immense blocks, which were seen rising up on high,
falling back again, clashing against one another, one mounting on top
of another, not without peril to the ship, which when dawn broke
through the clouds of night, opened out its canvas wings like a bird of
freedom and sailed towards the free ocean.</p>
<p>There they joined up with the fleet of Messire de Lumey de la
Marche, admiral of Holland and Zealand, and chief and captain-general,
and as such carrying a lantern at his ship&rsquo;s peak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look well at him, my son,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel;
&ldquo;that one will never spare thee, if thou shouldst wish to leave
the ship against orders. Hearest thou his voice breaking forth like
thunder? See how broad and strong he is in his great stature! Look
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>at his long hands with the crooked nails! See
his round eyes, eagle eyes and cold, and his long pointed beard that he
means to leave to grow until he has hanged all the monks and priests to
avenge the death of the two counts! See him redoubtable and cruel; he
will have thee hanged high on a short rope, if thou dost continue to
whine and cry always: &lsquo;My wife!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; replied Lamme, &ldquo;he that talks of a
halter for his neighbour has already the hempen cravat on his own
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou thyself shalt be the first to wear it. Such is my vow as
a friend,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see thee on the gallows,&rdquo; replied Lamme,
&ldquo;thrust out thy poisonous tongue a fathom out of thy
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And both were in mere jest.</p>
<p>On that day Tr&egrave;s-Long&rsquo;s ship took a ship from Biscay
laden with mercury, gold dust, wines, and spices. And the ship was
emptied of its marrow, men, and booty, as a beef bone under a
lion&rsquo;s teeth.</p>
<p>It was at this time also that the duke ordained in the Low Countries
cruel and abominable imposts, obliging all the inhabitants who sold
real or personal estate to pay one thousand florins in ten thousand.
And this tax was a permanent one. All sellers and buyers whatsoever
must pay the king the tenth part of the purchase price, and it was said
among the people that if goods were sold ten times within a week the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The world was in January, the cruel month that freezes
the calf in the cow&rsquo;s belly. It had snowed, and frozen over and
above. The lads were taking with birdlime sparrows seeking some poor
food on the hardened snow, and carried off this game into their
cottages. Against the gray clear sky stood out motionless the skeletons
of the trees, whose branches were covered with snowy cushions that
covered also the cottages and the coping of walls on which were seen
the prints of the paws of cats, which, like the boys, were hunting
sparrows over the snow. At a distance the meadows were hidden over by
this marvellous fleece, keeping the earth warm against the bitter cold
of winter. The smoke of houses and cottages rose up black into the sky,
and there was no noise heard of any kind.</p>
<p>And Katheline and Nele were alone in their house; and Katheline,
nodding her head, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, my heart turns to thee. Thou must give <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>back
the seven hundred carolus to Ulenspiegel, the son of Soetkin. If thou
art poor, come none the less that I may see thy shining face. Take away
the fire, my head burns. Alas! where are thy snow-cold kisses? Where is
thy icy body, Hans, my beloved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she kept at the window. Suddenly there passed, running at full
speed, a <i lang="nl">voet-looper</i>, a courier carrying bells at his
belt, and calling out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here cometh the bailiff, the high bailiff of
Damme!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went thus as far as the Townhall, so as to assemble there the
burgomasters and the sheriffs.</p>
<p>Then in the thick silence Nele heard two clarions sound. All the
people of Damme came to their doors, believing it was His Majesty the
king who announced himself by such flourishes.</p>
<p>And Katheline also went to the door with Nele. From afar they saw
resplendent horsemen riding in a band, and before them, also on
horseback, a personage covered in an <i lang="nl">opperst-kleed</i> of
black velvet laced with fine gold, and boots of yellow calfskin furred
with marten. And they recognized the high bailiff.</p>
<p>Behind him there rode young lords, who, notwithstanding the
ordinance of his late Imperial Majesty, wore on their velvet
accoutrements embroideries, trimmings, bands, edgings, of gold, of
silver, and of silk. And their <i lang="nl">opperst-kleederen</i>,
under their outer garments, were edged with fur like those of the
bailiff. They rode gaily along, shaking in the wind the long ostrich
feathers that adorned their bonnets, gold buttoned and gold laced.</p>
<p>And they seemed to be all of them good friends and companions of the
grand bailiff, and notably a lord of sharp visage clad in green velvet
trimmed with gold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>lace, and a cloak of black velvet like his
bonnet adorned with long plumes. And he had a nose shaped like a
vulture&rsquo;s beak, a thin mouth, red hair, a pale face, and haughty
carriage.</p>
<p>While the troop of these lords was passing in front of
Katheline&rsquo;s house suddenly she darted to the bridle of the pale
lord&rsquo;s horse, and beside herself with joy, she cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans! my beloved, I knew it; thou art back. Thou art goodly
thus in velvet and all in gold like a sun upon the snow! Dost thou
bring me the seven hundred carolus? Shall I hear thee once more crying
like the sea-eagle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The high bailiff stopped the troop of gentlemen, and the pale lord
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doth this beggar want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Katheline, still keeping hold of the horse by the bridle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go away again,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have wept so
much for thee. Sweet nights, my beloved, kisses of snow&mdash;body of
ice. The child is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she pointed him to Nele who was looking at him in anger, for he
had raised his whip to Katheline: but Katheline, weeping:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;dost thou not remember at all?
Have pity on thy handmaiden. Take her with thee wherever thou wilt.
Take away the fire, Hans; pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And he drove his horse on so hard that Katheline, loosing the
bridle, fell; and the horse stepped on her and gave her a bloody wound
in the forehead.</p>
<p>The bailiff then said to the pale lord:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire, do you know this woman?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know her at all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;doubtless it
is some mad creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nele, having raised Katheline from the ground:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this woman is mad, I am not, Monseigneur, and I pray that
I may die here of this snow that I eat&rdquo;&mdash;and she took up
snow in her fingers&mdash;&ldquo;if this man has not known my mother,
if he did not borrow all her money, if he did not kill Claes&rsquo;s
dog in order to take from the wall of the well at our house seven
hundred carolus belonging to the poor dead man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, my darling,&rdquo; wept Katheline, bleeding, and on her
knees, &ldquo;Hans, my beloved, give me the kiss of peace: see the
blood flowing: my soul has made the hole and would fain come forth: I
shall die presently: leave me not.&rdquo; Then in a whisper:
&ldquo;Long ago thou didst slay thy comrade for jealousy, along by the
dyke.&rdquo; And she stretched out her finger in the direction of
Dudzeele. &ldquo;Thou didst love me well in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she caught the gentleman&rsquo;s knee and embraced it, and she
took his boot and kissed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this slain man?&rdquo; asked the high bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We have
nothing to do with the talk of this beggarwoman; let us
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The populace was assembling around them; the townsmen great and
small, artisans and rustics, taking Katheline&rsquo;s part, cried
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice, Monseigneur Bailiff, justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bailiff said to Nele:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this slain man? Speak in accordance with God and the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele spoke and said, pointing to the pale gentleman: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This man came every Saturday to the keet to see my mother and
to take her money: he killed a friend of his, Hilbert by name, in the
field of Servaes van der Vichte, not for love, as this innocent
distracted woman thinks, but to have for himself alone the seven
hundred carolus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nele told of Katheline&rsquo;s loves and what she heard when she
was hidden by night behind the dyke that ran through the field of
Servaes van der Vichte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nele is bad,&rdquo; said Katheline; &ldquo;she speaks hardly
of Hans, her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;that he used to cry like a
sea-eagle to announce his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou liest,&rdquo; said the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;and monseigneur the bailiff
and all these noble lords here present see it well: thou art pale not
for cold, but with fear. Whence comes it that thy face no longer
shines: thou hast then lost thy magic compound wherewith thou wast wont
to rub it that it might appear bright, like the waves in summer when it
thunders? But sorcerer accursed, thou shalt be burned before the doors
of the Townhall. &rsquo;Tis thou that didst cause Soetkin&rsquo;s
death, thou that didst reduce her orphan son to want; thou, a man of
noble rank, doubtless, and who wast wont to come to us burgesses to
bring my mother money once only and to take money from her all the
other times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans,&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;thou wilt bring me again
to the Sabbath and wilt rub me again with ointment; do not listen to
Nele, she is bad: thou seest the blood, the soul has made the hole and
would come forth: I shall die soon and I shall go into limbo where it
burneth not.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold thy tongue, mad witch, I know thee not,&rdquo; said the
gentleman, &ldquo;and know not what thou wouldst say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;it was thou that camest
with a companion and wouldst have given him to me for a husband: thou
knowest that I would have none of him; what did he do, thy friend
Hilbert, what did he do with his eyes after I had sunk my nails into
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nele is bad,&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;do not believe
her, Hans, my darling: she is angry against Hilbert who would have
taken her by force, but Hilbert cannot do it now; the worms have eaten
him: and Hilbert was ugly. Hans, my darling, thou alone art goodly;
Nele is bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the bailiff said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women, go in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Katheline would by no means leave the place where her friend
was. And they must needs bring her to her house by force.</p>
<p>And all the people there assembled cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice, Monseigneur, justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constables of the commune having come up at the noise, the
bailiff bade them remain, and he said to the lords and gentlemen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messeigneurs and Messires, notwithstanding all privileges
protecting the illustrious order of nobility in the country of Flanders
I must needs, upon the accusations and especially upon that of
witchcraft, laid against Messire Joos Damman, have his person
apprehended until he be judged according to the laws and ordinances of
the Empire. Give me your sword, Messire Joos.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur Bailiff,&rdquo; said Joos Damman, with the utmost
hauteur and pride of nobility, &ldquo;in apprehending my person you are
transgressing the law of Flanders, for you are not yourself a judge.
Now you are aware that it is permitted to arrest without a warrant from
a judge only false coiners, robbers on public roads and highways;
fire-raisers, ravishers of women; gendarmes deserting their captain;
enchanters making use of poison to poison water springs; monks or nuns
that have renounced their vows and banished men. And now, Messires and
Messeigneurs, defend me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some would have obeyed, but the bailiff said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messeigneurs and Messires, as representing here our king,
count, and overlord, to whom is reserved the decision of difficult
cases, I command and order you, upon pain of being proclaimed rebels,
to return your swords to their scabbards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentlemen having obeyed, and Messire Joos Damman still
hesitating, the people cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice, Monseigneur, justice; let him give up his
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so then against his will, and dismounting from his horse, he
was brought by two constables to the prison of the commune.</p>
<p>All the same, he was not shut up in the cellars, but in a barred
chamber, where he had, for payment, a good fire, a good bed, and good
food, the half of which the gaoler took.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the next day the bailiff, the two clerks of the
court, two aldermen, and a barber-surgeon went by Dudzeele to see if
they might find in the field of Servaes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>van der Vichte the
body of a man along by the dyke running through the field.</p>
<p>Nele had said to Katheline: &ldquo;Hans, thy darling, asks for the
severed hand of Hilbert: this evening he will cry like the sea-eagle;
he will come into the cottage, and will bring thee the seven hundred
florins carolus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katheline had replied: &ldquo;I will cut it off.&rdquo; And indeed,
she took a knife and went forth accompanied by Nele and followed by the
officers of justice.</p>
<p>She walked swiftly and proudly beside Nele, whose pretty face the
keen air made all rosy and glowing.</p>
<p>The officers of justice, old and coughing, followed her, frozen with
cold; and they were all like black shadows on the white plain; and Nele
carried a spade.</p>
<p>When they arrived in the field of Servaes van der Vichte and on the
dyke, Katheline, walking up to the middle of it, said, pointing to the
meadow on her right hand: &ldquo;Hans, thou didst not know that I was
hidden there, shivering at the noise of the swords. And Hilbert cried
out: &lsquo;This iron is cold.&rsquo; Hilbert was ugly; Hans is goodly.
Thou shalt have his hand; leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went down on the left hand, knelt in the snow and cried
three times into the air to call the spirit.</p>
<p>Nele then gave her the spade, upon which Katheline made the sign of
the cross thrice; then she traced upon the ice the shape of a coffin
and three crosses reversed, one on the side of the east, one on the
side of the west, and one on the south; and she said: &ldquo;Three, it
is Mars beside Saturn, and three is discovery under Venus, the bright
star.&rdquo; She traced after, about the coffin, a great circle,
saying: &ldquo;Begone, evil demon that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>guardest
corpses.&rdquo; Then falling on her knees in prayer: &ldquo;Devil
friend, Hilbert,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Hans, my master and lord, bids
me come here and cut off thy hand and bring it to him. I owe him
obedience: make not the earth-fire to leap out against me, because I
disturb thy noble burying place: and forgive me in the name of God and
of the Saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she broke the ice, following the outline of the coffin: she
came to the damp sword, then to the sandy soil, and monseigneur the
bailiff, his officers, Nele, and Katheline beheld the body of a young
man, chalk-white by reason of the soil. He was clad in a doublet of
gray cloth with a cloak of the same; his sword was laid by his side. At
his belt he had a chain purse, and a big poignard planted under his
heart; and there was blood upon the cloth of the doublet; and that
blood had flowed under his back. And the man was young.</p>
<p>Katheline cut off his hand and put it in her pouch. And the bailiff
let her do what she would, then bade her to strip the body of all its
insignia and clothing. Katheline having asked if Hans had thus
commanded, the bailiff replied that he did nothing save by his orders;
and Katheline then did what he wished.</p>
<p>When the body was stripped, it was seen to be dry as wood, but not
decayed: and the bailiff and the officers of the commune departed,
having covered it again with sand: and the constables carried the
cloth.</p>
<p>Passing the front of the prison of the commune, the bailiff said to
Katheline that Hans was awaiting her there; she went in joyously.</p>
<p>Nele wanted to prevent her, and Katheline always replied: &ldquo;I
would see Hans, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nele wept on the threshold, knowing that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>Katheline was arrested as a witch for the
conjurations and figures she had made upon the snow.</p>
<p>And in Damme men said there could be no pardon for her.</p>
<p>And Katheline was put in the western cellar of the prison.</p>

<p class="first">The next day, the wind blowing from Brabant, the snow
melted and the meadows were flooded.</p>
<p>And the bell called <i>borgstorm</i> called the judges to the
tribunal of the <i>Vierschare</i>, under the penthouse, because of the
dampness of the turf.</p>
<p>And the populace surrounded the tribunal.</p>
<p>Joos Damman, being interrogated, confessed that he had killed his
friend Hilbert in single combat with the sword. When they said to him:
&ldquo;He was smitten with a poignard,&rdquo; Joos Damman replied:
&ldquo;I struck him on the ground because he died not quick enough. I
confess this murder of my own will, being under the protection of the
laws of Flanders which forbid the prosecution, after ten years, of a
manslayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff, addressing him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou not a sorcerer?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Damman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove this,&rdquo; said the bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will prove it at the proper time and place,&rdquo; said
Joos Damman, &ldquo;but it pleaseth me not to do so as now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff then questioned Katheline; she never listened to him,
and gazing at Hans:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art my green lord, lovely as the sun. Take away the
fire, my darling!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href=

<p>Nele, then speaking for Katheline, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can confess naught but what ye know already, Monseigneur
and Messieurs; she is no witch, and only bereft of her wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff then spoke and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sorcerer is one that, by diabolical means wittingly
employed, endeavours to attain somewhat. Now, these twain, man and
woman, are sorcerers by intent and deed: he, in having given the
ointment for the sabbath, and in having made his face bright like
Lucifer in order to obtain money and the satisfying of lewdness; she,
in having submitted herself to him, taking him for a devil, and for
having given herself up to his desires: the one being the worker of
witchcraft, the other his manifest accomplice. There can therefore be
no pity, and I must say this, for I perceive the aldermen and the
populace over-indulgent in the case of the woman. She has not, it is
true, killed or robbed, nor bewitched either beasts or mankind, nor
healed any sick by remedies extraordinary, but only by known simples,
as an honest and Christian physician; but she would have given up her
daughter to the devil, and if this maid had not in her youth resisted
with frank and valiant courage she would have yielded to Hilbert and
would have become a sorceress like the other. Accordingly, I put it to
the members of this tribunal if they are not of the opinion to put both
these two to the torture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aldermen made no answer, showing sufficiently that this was not
their desire with regard to Katheline.</p>
<p>The bailiff then said, continuing his discourse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, like yourselves, touched with pity and compassion for
her, but this sorceress, bereft of her wits, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>so
obedient to the devil, might she not, had her lewd co-defendant so
bidden her, have been capable of cutting off her daughter&rsquo;s head
with a sickle, even as Catherine Daru, in the country of France, did to
her two daughters at the invitation of the devil? Might she not, if her
black husband had so bidden her, have put animals to death; turned the
butter in the churn by throwing sugar in it; been present in the body
at all the worship and homage to the devil, dance, abominations, and
copulations of sorcerers? Might she not have eaten human flesh, killed
children to make pasties of them and sell them, as did a pastry cook in
Paris; cut off the thighs of hanged men and carry them away to bite
into them raw and thus commit infamous robbery and sacrilege? And I ask
of the tribunal that in order to discover whether Katheline and Joos
Damman have not committed other crimes than those already known and
called into account, they be both put to the torture. Joos Damman
refusing to confess anything further than the murder, and Katheline not
having told everything, the laws of the empire enjoin upon us to
proceed as I indicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the aldermen gave sentence of torture for the Friday which was
the day after the morrow.</p>
<p>And Nele cried: &ldquo;Grace, Messeigneurs!&rdquo; and the people
cried with her. But it was in vain.</p>
<p>And Katheline, looking at Joos Damman, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have Hilbert&rsquo;s hand; come and take it to-night, my
beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they were taken back to the prison.</p>
<p>There by order of the tribunal, the gaoler was ordered to assign two
guardians to each of them, to beat them every time they would have
slept; but the two guardians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=
"#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>of Katheline left her to sleep all
night, and those of Joos Damman beat him cruelly every time he closed
his eyes or even nodded his head.</p>
<p>They were hungry all day on Wednesday, the same night and all
Thursday until night, when they were given food and drink, meat salted
and saltpetred, and water salted and saltpetred likewise. That was the
beginning of their torment<span class="corr" id="xd20e6049" title=
"Not in source">.</span> And in the morning they brought them, crying
out for thirst, into the torture chamber.</p>
<p>There they were set face to face with one another, and bound each
upon a bench covered with knotted ropes which made them suffer
grievously.</p>
<p>And they were each forced to drink a glass of water, full of salt
and saltpetre.</p>
<p>Joos Damman beginning to sleep upon his bench, the constables struck
him.</p>
<p>And Katheline said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not strike him, sirs; you break his poor body. He only
committed one crime, for love, when he killed Hilbert. I am athirst,
and thou, too, Hans my beloved. Give him to drink first. Water! Water!
my body burns. Spare him, I will die soon in his place. A
drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joos said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugly witch, die and burst like a bitch. Throw her in the
fire, Messieurs the Judges. I am athirst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerks took down all he said.</p>
<p>The bailiff then said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou nothing to confess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing more to say,&rdquo; replied Damman; &ldquo;you
know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since he persists,&rdquo; said the bailiff, &ldquo;in his
denials, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>he shall remain on these benches and on these
cords until he makes a fresh and full confession, and he shall be
athirst, and he shall be kept from sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stay here,&rdquo; said Joos Damman, &ldquo;and I will
take my pleasure in seeing that witch suffer on this bench. How do you
find the marriage bed, my love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katheline replied, groaning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold arms and hot heart, Hans, my beloved. I am athirst; my
head burns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, woman,&rdquo; said the bailiff, &ldquo;hast thou
naught to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the chariot of death and the
dry noise of bones. I thirst! And he taketh me to a great river where
there is water, water fresh and clear; but this water it is fire. Hans,
my dear, deliver me from these cords. Yea, I am in purgatory and I see
on high Monseigneur Jesus in his paradise and Madame Virgin so full of
compassion. O our dear Lady, give me one drop of water: do not eat
those lovely fruits all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This woman is smitten with cruel madness,&rdquo; said one of
the aldermen. &ldquo;She must be taken from the bench of
torment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is no more mad than I,&rdquo; said Joos Damman; &ldquo;it
is mere play and acting.&rdquo; And in a threatening voice: &ldquo;I
shall see thee in the fire,&rdquo; he said to Katheline, &ldquo;thou
playest the madwoman so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And grinding his teeth, he laughed at his cruel lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thirst,&rdquo; said Katheline; &ldquo;have pity, I thirst.
Hans, my beloved, give me to drink. How white thy face is! Let me come
to him, Messieurs the Judges.&rdquo; And opening her mouth wide:
&ldquo;Yea, yea, they are now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>putting fire in my breast,
and the devils fasten me on this cruel bed. Hans, take thy sword and
slay them, thou so mighty. Water, to drink, to drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perish, witch,&rdquo; said Joos Damman; &ldquo;they ought to
thrust a choke-pear into her mouth to keep her from setting herself up
thus, a low creature like her, against me, a man of rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this word one of the aldermen, an enemy of the nobility,
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire Bailiff, it is contrary to the laws and customs of
the empire to put a choke-pear into the mouth of any that are being
interrogated, for they are here to tell the truth, and for us to judge
them from what they say. That is permitted only when the accused being
condemned might, upon the scaffold, speak to the people, and in this
way move them, and stir up popular feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thirst,&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;give me to drink,
Hans, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou dost suffer, accursed witch,
sole cause of all the torments I am enduring; but in this torture
chamber thou shalt undergo the pain of the candles, the strappado, the
wooden splinters under the nails of thy feet and hands. They will make
thee ride naked astride a coffin whose back will be sharp as a blade,
and thou shalt confess that thou art not mad, but a foul witch to whom
Satan hath given it in charge to work evil upon noble men. A
drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, my beloved,&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;be not wroth
with thy handmaiden! I suffer a thousand pangs for thee, my lord. Spare
him, Messieurs the Judges. Give him a full goblet to drink, and keep
but one drop for me. Hans, is it not yet the hour of the
sea-eagle?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224"
name="pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bailiff then said to Joos Damman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When thou didst kill Hilbert, what was the motive of this
combat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Joos, &ldquo;for a girl at Heyst we both
wished to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl at Heyst!&rdquo; cried Katheline, trying at all costs
to rise up from her bench; &ldquo;thou art deceiving me for another,
traitor devil. Didst thou know that I was listening to thee behind the
dyke when thou saidst that thou wouldst fain have all the money, which
was Claes&rsquo;s money? Without doubt it was to go and spend it with
her in liquorishness and revelling! Alas! and I that would have given
him my blood if he could have made gold of it! And all for another! Be
accursed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly, weeping and trying to turn round on her bench of
torture:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Hans, say that thou wilt still love thy poor handmaid,
and I shall scratch the earth with my fingers and find thee a treasure;
aye, there is such; and I will go with the hazel twig that bends this
way and that where there are metals; and I will find it and bring it
back to thee; kiss me, darling, and thou shalt be rich; and we shall
eat meat, and we shall drink beer every day; aye, aye, all these folk
also drink beer; fresh, foaming beer. Oh! sirs, give me but one single
drop; I am in the fire; Hans, I know well where there are hazel trees,
but we must wait for the spring time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold thy tongue, witch,&rdquo; said Joos Damman; &ldquo;I
know thee not. Thou hast taken Hilbert for me: it was he that came to
see thee. And in thy wicked mind thou didst call him Hans. Know that I
am not called Hans, but Joos: we were of the same height, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>Hilbert and I. I do not know thee; it was
Hilbert, without doubt, that stole the seven hundred florins carolus;
give me to drink; my father will pay a hundred florins for a little
goblet of water; but I know not this woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur and Messires,&rdquo; exclaimed Katheline,
&ldquo;he saith he knows me not, but I know him well, I, and know that
he hath upon his back a mole, brown, and of the size of a bean. Ah!
thou didst love a girl at Heyst! Doth a good lover blush for his lover?
Hans, am I not still fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou hast a face like a medlar
and a body like a century of faggots: see the trash that would be loved
by noble men! Give me to drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou didst not speak so, Hans, my sweet lord,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;when I was sixteen years younger than I am now.&rdquo;
Then, beating her head and her breast: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the fire that
is there,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and dries up my heart and withers my
face. Do not reproach me with it; dost thou remember when we ate salt
meat to drink better, so thou saidst? Now the salt is in us, my
beloved, and monseigneur the bailiff is drinking Romagna wine. We do
not want wine: give us water. It runs among the grass, the streamlet
that makes the clear spring; the good water, it is cold. Nay, it burns.
It is water of hell.&rdquo; And Katheline wept, and she said: &ldquo;I
have done ill to no one, and the whole world casteth me into the fire.
Give me to drink; men give water to straying dogs. I am a Christian
woman. Give me to drink. I have done no ill to any. Give me to
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An alderman then spoke and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This witch is mad only in what concerns the fire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>she
saith burns her head, but she is nowise mad upon other matters, since
she helped us with a clear head to discover the remains of the dead
man. If the mole is there upon the body of Joos Damman, that sign
sufficeth to establish his identity with the devil Hans, for whom
Katheline was out of her wits; tormentor, let us see the
mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tormentor, uncovering Damman&rsquo;s neck and shoulder, showed
the mole, brown and hairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;how white is thy skin! One
would say a girl&rsquo;s shoulders; thou art goodly, Hans, my beloved:
give me to drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tormentor then thrust a long needle into the mole. But it did
not bleed.</p>
<p>And the aldermen said one to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is a devil, and he must have killed Joos Damman and
taken his shape the more securely to deceive the poor world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bailiff and the aldermen fell into fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a devil and there is witchcraft in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Joos Damman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know there is no witchcraft, and that there are such
fleshy excrescences that can be pricked without bleeding. If Hilbert
hath taken this witch&rsquo;s money, for it is she that confesseth to
have lain with the devil, he could well have done so by the good and
free will of this foul hag. And was thus, being a man of rank, paid for
his caresses even as <i>bona robas</i> are every day. Are there not in
the world, the same as girls, gay fellows that make women pay for their
strength and comeliness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aldermen said one to another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you his diabolical assurance? His hairy wart <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>hath
not bled: being an assassin, a devil, and a magician, he would fain
pass simply for a duellist, throwing his other crimes on to the devil
his friend, whose body he has killed, but not his spirit.... And
consider how pale his face is.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thus appear all the
devils, red in hell, and pale on earth, for they have none of the fire
of life that giveth ruddiness to the countenance, and they are ashes
within.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;We must put him in the fire that he may be
red and that he may burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Katheline:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, he is a devil, but a kind devil, a sweet devil. And
Monseigneur Saint Jacques, his patron, has given him licence to come
out of hell. He prays Monseigneur Jesus for him every day. He will have
but seven thousand years of purgatory: Madame Virgin wishes it, but
Monsieur Satan is against it. None the less Madame does what she has a
mind to. Will he go against her? If ye consider well, ye shall see he
hath kept naught of his estate and condition as a devil, save the cold
body, and also the face luminous as are the waves of the sea in August
when it is like to thunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Joos Damman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold thy tongue, witch, thou wilt burn me.&rdquo; Then
speaking to the bailiff and the aldermen: &ldquo;Look at me, I am no
devil; I have flesh and bones, blood and water. I drink and eat, digest
and void like yourselves; my skin is like yours, my foot likewise;
tormentor, take my boots off, for I cannot budge with my feet
bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tormentor did so, not without fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Joos, showing his white feet: &ldquo;are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>those cloven feet, devil&rsquo;s feet? As for my
paleness, is there none of you that is pale like me? I see more than
three among you. But the sinner is not I, but verily this ugly witch,
and her daughter, the evil accuser. Whence did she have the money she
lent to Hilbert; whence came those florins that she gave him? Was it
not the devil that paid her to accuse and bring death to men of noble
birth and guiltless? It is those twain that should be asked who killed
the dog in the yard, who dug the hole and went off leaving it empty,
doubtless to hide the stolen treasure in another place. Soetkin the
widow had placed no trust in me, for she never knew me, but in them,
and saw them every day. It is they that stole the Emperor&rsquo;s
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk wrote, and the bailiff said to Katheline:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, hast thou naught to say for thy defence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katheline, looking upon Joos Damman, said most amorously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the hour of the sea-eagle. I have Hilbert&rsquo;s hand,
Hans, my beloved. They say that thou wilt give me back the seven
hundred carolus. Take away the fire! Take away the fire!&rdquo; cried
she after that. &ldquo;Give me to drink! to drink! my head burns. God
and the angels are eating apples in the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she lost consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loosen her from the bench of torment,&rdquo; said the
bailiff.</p>
<p>The tormentor and his assistants obeyed. And she was seen staggering
and with feet swollen out, for the tormentor had pulled the cords too
tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her to drink,&rdquo; said the bailiff.</p>
<p>Cold water was given her, and she swallowed it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>greedily, holding the goblet in her teeth as a
dog does with a bone and not willing to let it go. Then they gave her
more water, and she would have gone to take it to Joos Damman, but the
tormentor took the goblet out of her hands. And she fell sleeping like
a lump of lead.</p>
<p>Joos Damman cried out furiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, I thirst and am sleepy. Why do you give her to drink?
Why do you leave her to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is weak, a woman, and out of her wits,&rdquo; replied the
bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her madness is a game,&rdquo; said Joos Damman, &ldquo;she is
a witch. I want to drink, I want to sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he shut his eyes, but the tormentor&rsquo;s <i>knechts</i>
struck him on the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a knife,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;till I cut these
clowns to pieces: I am a man of rank, and I have never been struck in
the face. Water, let me sleep, I am innocent. It was not I that took
the seven hundred carolus, it was Hilbert. Give me to drink! I never
committed sorceries or incantations. I am innocent. Let me go. Give me
to drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;hast thou spent thy time since
thou didst leave Katheline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not Katheline; I have never left her,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Ye question me on matters foreign to the case. I need not answer
you. Give me to drink; let me sleep. I tell you it was Hilbert that did
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Untie him,&rdquo; said the bailiff. &ldquo;Take him back to
his prison. But let him thirst and have no sleep until he hath
confessed his sorceries and incantations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was a cruel torture to Damman. He cried <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>out
in his cell: &ldquo;Give me to drink! Give me to drink!&rdquo; so loud
that the people heard him, but without any pity. And when his guardians
struck him in the face as he was falling with sleep, he was like a
tiger and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a man of rank and will kill you, ye clowns. I will go to
the king, our head. Give me to drink.&rdquo; But he confessed nothing,
and they left him alone.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They were then in May, the lime tree of justice was
green; green, too, were the turf seats upon which the judges placed
themselves; Nele was called as witness. On this day sentence was to be
pronounced.</p>
<p>And the people, men, women, townsfolk, and artisans were all round
about in the field; and the sun shone bright.</p>
<p>Katheline and Joos Damman were brought before the tribunal; and
Damman appeared paler than ever by reason of the torture of the thirst
and the nights spent without sleep.</p>
<p>Katheline, who could not maintain herself on her shaking legs, said,
pointing to the sun:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take away the fire; my head burns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she looked on Joos Damman with tender love.</p>
<p>And he looked at her with hate and contempt.</p>
<p>And the lords and gentlemen his friends, having been summoned to
Damme, were all present as witnesses before the tribunal.</p>
<p>Then the bailiff spake and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nele, the girl who defends her mother Katheline with such
great and courageous affection, found in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>pocket stitched in her mother&rsquo;s jacket, a
jacket for feast days, a note signed &lsquo;Joos Damman.&rsquo; Among
the belongings taken from the corpse of Hilbert Ryvish I found in the
dead man&rsquo;s satchel another letter addressed to him by the said
Joos Damman, the defendant here present before you. I have kept both
these letters in my custody, in order that at the appropriate moment,
which is the present, you might judge of this man&rsquo;s obstinacy and
acquit or condemn him in accordance with law and justice. Here is the
parchment found in the satchel; I have never touched it, and know not
whether it is legible or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judges were then in great perplexity.</p>
<p>The bailiff endeavoured to undo the parchment ball; but it was in
vain, and Joos Damman laughed.</p>
<p>An alderman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us put the ball in water, and then before the fire. If
there is in it any secret of adhesion, the fire and the water will melt
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was brought; the executioner lit a great fire of wood in
the field; the smoke rose up blue into the clear sky through the
verdurous branches of the lime tree of justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not put the letter in the basin,&rdquo; said an alderman
&ldquo;for if it is written with sal ammoniac dissolved in water, you
will efface the characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the surgeon, who was there, &ldquo;the
characters will not be effaced; the water will soften only the point
that keeps the magic ball from opening up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parchment was dipped in the water and being softened, was
unfolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;put it before the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;put the paper before the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>fire; master surgeon is on the road to the
truth, for the murderer grows pale and trembles in his
limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, Messire Joos Damman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither grew pale nor trembled, thou little common harpy
that art fain of the death of a man of rank; thou shalt never succeed;
this parchment must needs be rotten, after sixteen years&rsquo;
sojourning in the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parchment is not decayed,&rdquo; said the sheriff,
&ldquo;for the satchel was lined with silk; silk is not consumed in the
earth, and the worms have not gone through the parchment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parchment was put in front of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur Bailiff, Monseigneur Bailiff,&rdquo; said Nele,
&ldquo;there is the ink appearing before the fire; give orders that the
writing be read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the surgeon was about to read it, Messire Joos Damman would have
stretched out his arms to seize the parchment; but Nele flung herself
upon his arm quick as the wind and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not touch it, for thereon is written thy death or
the death of Katheline. If now thy heart bleeds, murderer, there are
fifteen years through which ours have been bleeding; fifteen years that
Katheline suffers; fifteen years she had her brain in her head burned
by thee; fifteen years that Soetkin is dead by consequence of the
torture; fifteen years that we are needy, ragged, and live in abject
want, but proudly. Read the paper, read the paper! The judges are God
upon earth, for they are Justice; read the paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read the paper!&rdquo; cried the men and women, weeping.
&ldquo;Nele is a brave lass! read the paper! Katheline is no
witch!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the clerk read:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;To Hilbert, son of Willem Ryvish, Esquire, Joos
Damman, greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed friend, lose thy money no more in gambling dens, at
dice, and other follies. I will tell thee how it can be won for very
certain. Let us make us devils, handsome devils, beloved of women and
of girls. Let us take the fair and rich, let us leave the ugly and
poor; let them pay for their pleasure. I made, at this trade, in six
months five thousand rixdaeldars in the country of Germany. Women will
give their petticoat and chemise to their man when they love him; flee
from the miserly ones with pinched up nose that take time to pay for
their pleasures. For thy own affair, and to appear goodly and a true
devil, an incubus, if they accept thee for the night, announce thy
coming by crying like a night bird. And to make thee a veritable
devil&rsquo;s face, of a terrifying devil, rub thy visage with
phosphorus, which is luminous in spots when it is damp. Its odour is
disagreeable, but they will believe that it is the odour of hell. Slay
what is in thy way, man, woman, or beast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon go together to the house of Katheline, a fine
good-natured wench; her daughter Nele, a child of my own, if Katheline
was faithful to me, is comely and pretty; thou wilt take her easily; I
give her to thee, for I care but little for these bastards that cannot
for certain be recognized as one&rsquo;s own offspring. Her mother gave
me already more than twenty-three carolus, all she possessed. But she
hath a treasure hidden, which is, unless I be a fool, the inheritance
of Claes, the heretic burned at Damme: seven hundred florins carolus
liable to confiscation, but the good King Philip, who had so many of
his subjects burned to inherit after them, could never lay his claw on
this sweet treasure. It will weigh <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234"
href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>more in my pouch than in his.
Katheline will tell me where it is; we shall divide. Only thou must
leave me the greater part for the discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the women, being our gentle handmaids and slaves in
love, we shall take them to the land of Germany. There we shall teach
them to become female demons and succubae, drawing the love of all the
rich burgesses and men of birth; there we shall live, they and we, upon
love paid for with good rixdaeldars, velvets, silk, gold, pearls, and
jewels; we shall thus be rich without fatigue, and, unknown to the
succubae devils, beloved by the most lovely, always exacting payment
besides. All women are fools and ninnies for the man that can light the
fire of love that God set beneath their girdles. Katheline and Nele
will be more so than others, and believing us to be devils, will obey
us in all things: thou, do thou keep thy forename, but never give the
name of thy father, Ryvish. If the judge seizes the women, we shall
depart without their knowing us or being able to denounce us. To the
rescue, my trusty comrade. Fortune smiles on the young, as was wont to
say his late Sainted Majesty Charles the Fifth, past master in affairs
of love and of war.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And the clerk, making an end of reading, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is this letter, and it is signed, &lsquo;Joos Damman,
esquire&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the people shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the death with the murderer! To the death with the
sorcerer! To the fire the turner of women&rsquo;s wits! To the gallows
with the robber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff said then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People, keep silence, that in all freedom we may judge this
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And speaking to the aldermen: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"
href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;read to you the second letter,
found by Nele in the pocket of Katheline&rsquo;s festal jacket; it is
conceived as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Darling Witch, here is the recipe of a compound
sent me by the very wife of Lucifer: by the help of this compound thou
wilt be able to transport thyself to the sun, the moon, and the stars,
converse with the elemental spirits that carry the prayers of men unto
God, and to traverse all the towns and burgs and rivers and fields of
the whole universe. Thou art to bruise together in equal quantities:
stramonium, sleep-solanum, henbane, opium, the fresh tips of hemp,
belladonna, and datura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou wilt, we shall go this night to the sabbath of the
spirits: but thou must love me better and not be miserly again like the
other night, when thou didst refuse me ten florins, saying thou didst
not have them. I know that thou dost hide a treasure and wilt not tell
me of it. Dost thou love me no longer, my sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;Thy cold devil,</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Hanske</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the death with the sorcerer!&rdquo; cried the people.</p>
<p>The bailiff said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must compare the two writings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This being done, they were adjudged to be similar. The bailiff then
said to the lords and gentlemen there present:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye recognize this man for Messire Joos Damman, son of the
alderman of La Keure of Ghent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Messire Hilbert, son of
Willem Ryvish, Esquire?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the gentlemen, who was called Van der Zickelen, spoke and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am from Ghent; my house is in St. Michael&rsquo;s Place; I
know Willem Ryvish, Esquire, sheriff of La Keure of Ghent. He lost,
fifteen years past, a son of twenty-three years of age, debauched, a
gamester, an idler; but everyone forgave it him because of his youth.
Since that time no man has had news of him. I ask to see the sword, the
poignard, and the satchel of the dead man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having them before him, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sword and the poignard carry on the pommel of the hilt
the arms of the Ryvishes, which are three silver fish on an azure
field. I see the same arms reproduced on a gold shield between the
meshes of his pouch. What is that other poignard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that poignard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which was found
planted in the body of Hilbert Ryvish, the son of Willem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognize on it,&rdquo; said the lord, &ldquo;the arms of
the Dammans; the tower gules on a silver field. So keep me God and all
his saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other gentlemen also said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognize the aforesaid arms for those of Ryvish and of
Damman. So keep us God and all his saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bailiff said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the evidence heard and read by the tribunal of aldermen,
Messire Joos Damman is the sorcerer, a murderer, a seducer of women, a
robber of the king&rsquo;s goods, and as such guilty of the crime of
treason human and divine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say so, Messire Bailiff,&rdquo; rejoined Joos, &ldquo;but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>you will not condemn me, lacking sufficient
proofs: I am not nor ever was a sorcerer; I did but play at the game of
being a devil. As for my shining face, you have the recipe for it and
that for the unguent, the which, while containing henbane, is merely
soporific. When this woman, a real witch, used it, she fell in a
trance, and thought she went to the sabbath and there danced in the
ring with her face to the outside of the circle, and adored a devil
with the shape of a goat, set upon an altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dance being over, she thought she went and kissed him
under the tail, as sorcerers do, to give herself up thereafter with me,
her friend, to strange copulations pleasing to her perverted mind. If I
had, as she says, cold arms and cool body, it was a mark of youth, not
of sorcery. In the works of love coolness doth not endure. But
Katheline would fain believe what she desired, and take me for a devil
notwithstanding that I am a man of flesh and bone, in everything as
yourselves that look at me. She alone is guilty: taking me for a demon
and receiving me in her bed, she sinned both in intention and deed
against God and the Holy Spirit. It is therefore she, and not I, that
committed the crime of sorcery; it is she that is to be made to pass
through the fire, as a furious and malignant witch that seeks to make
herself pass for a madwoman, in order to hide her cunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nele:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye hear him,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the murderer? He
hath, like a girl for sale, with the armlet on her arm, made a trade
and merchandise of love. Do ye hear him? He means, to save himself, to
have her burned that gave him all.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nele is bad,&rdquo; said Katheline, &ldquo;do not listen to
her, Hans, my beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;nay, thou art no man: thou art
a cowardly cruel devil.&rdquo; And taking Katheline in her arms:
&ldquo;Messieurs Judges,&rdquo; exclaimed she, &ldquo;listen not to
this pale evil one: he hath but one wish, to see my mother burn, she
that did no other crime but to be smitten by God with madness, and to
believe the phantoms of her dreams real. She hath already suffered much
in her body and in her mind. Do not put her to death, Messieurs the
Judges. Leave the innocent to live out her sad life in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katheline said: &ldquo;Nele is bad; thou must not believe her,
Hans my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And among the common folk the women were weeping and the men said:
&ldquo;Pardon for Katheline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bailiff and the aldermen gave their sentence on Joos Damman,
upon a confession which he made after being tortured afresh: he was
condemned to be degraded from his noble estate and burned alive in a
slow fire until death ensued, and suffered the penalty the next day
before the doors of the Townhall, still saying: &ldquo;Put the witch to
death; she alone is guilty! Cursed be God! my father will slay the
judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he rendered up the ghost.</p>
<p>And the people said: &ldquo;See him cursing and a blasphemer: he
dies like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day the bailiff and the aldermen gave their sentence upon
Katheline, who was condemned to undergo the trial by water in the
Bruges Canal. Floating, she should be burned as a witch; going to the
bottom and dying, she should be regarded as dying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>like
a Christian, and as such should be interred in the garden of the
church, which is the graveyard.</p>
<p>The day after, Katheline, holding a wax taper in her hand,
barefooted and clad in a chemise of black linen, was brought to the
bank of the canal, all along by the trees, in grand procession. Before
her marched, singing the prayers for the dead, the dean of Notre Dame,
his vicars, the beadle carrying the cross; and behind, the bailiffs of
Damme, the aldermen, the clerks and recorders, the constables of the
commune, the provost, the executioner and his two assistants. Upon the
banks there was a great crowd of women weeping and men growling, in
pity for Katheline, who walked as a lamb suffering herself to be led
she knew not whither, and always saying: &ldquo;Take away the fire, my
head burns! Hans, where art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of the women Nele cried: &ldquo;I want to be thrown in
with her.&rdquo; But the women did not suffer her to come near to
Katheline.</p>
<p>A sharp wind blew from the sea; from the gray sky a fine hail was
falling into the water of the canal; a bark was there, which the
executioner and his men seized in the name of His Majesty the king. At
their command, Katheline went into it; the executioner was seen,
standing in it, and at the signal of the provost lifting his wand of
justice, he cast Katheline into the canal: she struggled, but not for
long, and went to the bottom, having cried out: &ldquo;Hans! Hans!
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the people said: &ldquo;This woman is no witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men plunged into the canal and pulled Katheline out from it,
unconscious and rigid as a corpse. Then she was brought into a tavern
and placed before a great fire; Nele took off her clothes and her wet
linen, to give <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>her others; when she came back to herself, she
said, trembling and chattering her teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans, give me a woollen cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Katheline could not get back her warmth. And she died on the
third day. And she was interred in the garden of the church.</p>
<p>And Nele, orphaned, departed to the land of Holland, to Rosa van
Auweghen.</p>

<p class="first">Upon the hulls of Zealand, on <i>boyers</i>, on
<i>croust&egrave;ves</i>, away goes Thyl Claes Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The free sea wafts the valiant flyboats on which are eight, ten or
twenty guns all of iron: they belch forth death and massacre on the
traitor Spaniards.</p>
<p>He is an expert gunner, Thyl Ulenspiegel, son of Claes, lo how he
aims straight and true, and pierces like a wall of butter the carcases
of the butchers.</p>
<p>In his hat he wears the silver crescent, with this legend:
&ldquo;<i lang="nl">Liever den Turc als den Paus</i>&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Rather to serve the Turk than the Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailors that see him climb up upon their ships, agile as a cat,
supple as a squirrel, singing some song or other, with some gay jest in
his mouth, would ask him curiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence is it, little man, that thou hast so young a mien, for
they say thou wert born long ago at Damme?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no body, but a spirit,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and Nele,
my sweetheart, is like me. Spirit of Flanders, love of Flanders, we
shall never die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;when thou art cut, thou
dost bleed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241"
name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see but the appearance of it,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;it is wine and not blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will broach thy belly, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be the only one to drain it,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art mocking us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that beats the case will hear the drum,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And the embroidered banners of the Roman Catholic processions
floated from the masts of the ships. And clad in velvet, in brocade, in
silk, in cloth of gold and of silver, such as abbots wear at solemn
masses, bearing mitre and crozier, drinking the monks&rsquo; wine, the
Beggars kept guard on their ships.</p>
<p>And it was a strange sight to behold appearing from out of these
rich vestments those coarse hands that held arquebus or arbalest,
halberd or pike, and all men of hard physiognomy, girt about with
pistols and cutlasses gleaming in the sun, and drinking from golden
chalices the abbots&rsquo; wine that had become the wine of
liberty.</p>
<p>And they sang and they shouted: &ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;
and thus they scoured the ocean and the Scheldt.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 id="xd20e6481" class="main">VIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this time the Beggars, among whom were Lamme and
Ulenspiegel, took Gorcum. And they were commanded by Captain Marin:
this Marin, who had been a workman on the dykes, disported himself with
great haughtiness and sufficiency, and signed with Gaspard Turc, the
defender of Gorcum, a capitulation whereby Turc, the monks, burgesses,
and soldiers shut up in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=
"#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>citadel were to come forth freely,
bullet in mouth, musket on shoulder, with all that they could carry,
save that the goods of the Church should be left to the assailants.</p>
<p>But Captain Marin, upon an order from Messire de Lumey, held the
<span class="corr" id="xd20e6489" title=
"Source: thirteen">nineteen</span> monks as prisoners, and let the
soldiers and the citizens go free.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word of a soldier should be a word of gold. Why doth he
fail of his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ancient Beggar made answer to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monks are sons of Satan, the leprosy of nations, the
shame of countries. Since the coming of the Duke of Alba, these fellows
lifted up their noses high in Gorcum. There is among them one, the
priest Nicolas, prouder than a peacock and fiercer than a tiger. Every
time he passed in the street with his pyx in which was his host made
with dog&rsquo;s fat, he would look with eyes full of fury at the
houses from which the women did not come and kneel, and would denounce
to the judge all that did not bend the knee before his idol of dough
and gilded brass. The other monks imitated him. That was the cause of
many great oppressions, burnings, and cruel punishments in the town of
Gorcum. Captain Marin does well to keep prisoner the monks who would
else go off with their likes into villages, burgs, towns, and townlets,
to preach against us, stirring up the populace and causing the poor
reformers to be burned. Mastiffs are put on the chain until they die:
to the chain with the monks; to the chain with the <i lang=
"nl">bloed-honden</i>, the duke&rsquo;s blood-hounds; to the cage with
the butchers. Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;Monseigneur
d&rsquo;Orange, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243"
name="pb243">243</a>]</span>our prince of liberty, wills that we should
respect, among those who surrender, the property of individuals and
freedom of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient Beggars replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The admiral wills it not for the monks: he is master; he took
Briele. To the cage with the monks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word of a soldier, word of gold! why does he fail of
it?&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;The monks kept in prison suffer
a thousand insults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat no longer upon thy heart,&rdquo; said they:
&ldquo;a hundred thousand families, in consequence of the edicts, have
taken over yonder, to the north-west, to the land of England, the
trades, the industry, the wealth of our country; bemoan then those that
wrought our ruin! Under the Emperor Charles the Fifth, Butcher the
First, under this one, the king of Blood, Butcher the Second, one
hundred and eighteen thousand persons have perished by execution. Who
carried the taper of the obsequies in murder and in tears? Monks and
soldiers of Spain. Dost thou not hear the souls of the dead
lamenting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;Word of a soldier, &rsquo;tis word of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;would by excommunication
have put the country under the ban of all nations? Who would have armed
against us, had it been possible, earth and sky, God and the devil, and
their serried ranks of saints, both male and female? Who made the
sacred host bleed with the blood of an ox, who made wooden statues
weep? Who had the <i lang="la">De Profundis</i> sung in the land of our
fathers, if not this accursed clergy, these hordes of lazy monks, in
order that they might keep their riches, their influence over idol
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>worshippers, and reign over the poor country by
ruin, blood, and fire. To the cage with the wolves that rush upon men
on earth; to the cage with the hy&aelig;nas! Long live the
Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word of a soldier, word of gold,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The next day a message came from Messire de Lumey, with orders to
transfer from Gorcum to Briele, where the admiral was, the nineteen
monks that were prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be hanged,&rdquo; said Captain Marin to
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I am alive,&rdquo; replied he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;speak not thus to Messire
de Lumey. He is fierce, and will hang thee with them without
mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall speak according to the truth,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;word of a soldier, word of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou canst save them,&rdquo; said Marin, &ldquo;take their
boat to Briele. Take with thee Rochus the pilot and thy friend Lamme if
thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish it,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The boat was moored at the Green quay; the nineteen monks entered
into it; Rochus the timid was set at the helm; Ulenspiegel and Lamme,
well armed, took their place at the prow of the ship. Certain rascal
troopers that had come among the Beggars for pillage were beside the
monks, who were hungry. Ulenspiegel gave them drink and food.
&ldquo;That one is going to turn traitor!&rdquo; said the rascal
troopers. The nineteen monks, seated amidships, were all gaping and
shivering, though it was July, and the sun was bright and hot, and a
gentle breeze filled out the sails of the ship as she glided massive
and bulging over the green waves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245"
href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>Father Nicolas then spake and said to the pilot:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rochus, are we being brought to the Gallows Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning towards Gorcum: &ldquo;O town of Gorcum!&rdquo; said
he, standing and stretching out his hand, &ldquo;town of Gorcum! how
many woes hast thou to suffer: thou shalt be accursed among cities, for
thou hast grown within thy walls the grain of heresy! O town of Gorcum!
And the angel of the Lord shall watch no longer at thy gates. He will
have no more care of thy virgins&rsquo; modesty, the courage of thy
men, the fortune of thy merchants! O town of Gorcum! thou art accursed,
unfortunate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accursed, accursed,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;accursed as the comb that hath passed through and taken away the
Spanish lice, accursed as the dog breaking his chain, as the proud
horse shaking a cruel rider from off his back! Accursed thyself, booby
preacher, who findest ill that the rod should be broken, were it an
iron rod upon the tyrants&rsquo; back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk held his tongue, and lowering his eyes, appeared steeped in
holy hate.</p>
<p>The rascal soldiers that had come among the Beggars for the sake of
pillage were close by the monks, who soon were hungry. Ulenspiegel
asked biscuit and herrings for them; the ship master answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them be thrown into the Meuse, they can have fresh
herring to eat then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then gave the monks all the bread and sausage he had for
himself and for Lamme. The ship-master and the rascal Beggars said one
to another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is a traitor, he is feeding the monks; we must
denounce him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd20e6565" title="Source: AttDordrecht">At
Dordrecht</span> the ship stopped in the Harbour at the Bloemen-Key,
the Flower quay; men, women, lads, and lasses ran up in crowds to see
the monks, and said to one another pointing at them with a finger or
threatening them with their fist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at those clowns, manufacturers of Bons Dieux that bring
men&rsquo;s bodies to the stake and their souls to the fire
everlasting; look at the fat tigers and big-bellied jackals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monks hung their heads and dared not speak. Ulenspiegel saw them
trembling once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are hungry again,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;compassionate
soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the ship master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is always drinking? Dry sand. Who eats without ceasing?
The monk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went up the town to find bread for them, ham, and a
great jug of beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat and drink,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;ye are our prisoners,
but I shall save you if I can. Word of a soldier, word of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou give them that? They will never pay you,&rdquo;
said the rascal Beggars; and talking among themselves they whispered
these words in each other&rsquo;s ears: &ldquo;He has promised to save
them; let us keep good watch upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dawn they came to Briele. The gates having been opened to them, a
<i lang="nl">voet-looper</i>, a courier, went to inform Messire de
Lumey of their coming.</p>
<p>As soon as he had the news, he came on horseback, having just put on
his clothes, and accompanied by some horsemen and foot-soldiers, with
their weapons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel could see once more the fierce admiral clad like a
proud lord living in opulence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail and greeting,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Messires the monks.
Lift up your hands. Where is the blood of Messieurs d&rsquo;Egmont and
de Hoorn? Ye show me clean white paws; &rsquo;tis well for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A monk called Leonard answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do with us as thou wilt. We are monks; no one will claim
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hath well said,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;for the
monk having broken with the world, which is father and mother, brother
and sister, spouse and lover, finds at the hour of God no soul that
claims him. And yet, Your Excellency, I will do so. Captain Marin, when
he signed the capitulation of Gorcum, agreed that these monks should be
free as all those that were taken in the citadel, and who came out from
it. And yet they were held prisoner without cause; I hear it said they
shall be hanged. Monseigneur, I address myself humbly to you, speaking
to you on their behalf, for I know that the word of a soldier is word
of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked Messire de Lumey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;Fleming am I
from the goodly land of Flanders, clown, nobleman, all at once, and
through the world in this wise I go wandering, praising things good and
lovely, and mocking folly without stint. And I will praise you if you
keep to the promise made by the captain: word of a soldier, word of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the rascally Beggars that were upon the ship:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;that fellow is a
traitor: he hath promised to save them; he hath given them bread, ham,
sausages, and beer, and to us nothing.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>Messire de Lumey said then to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fleming gadabout and monk feeder, thou shalt be hanged with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no fear,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;word of a
soldier, word of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou carriest thy comb high,&rdquo; said de Lumey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>The monks were brought into a barn, and Ulenspiegel with them: there
they would fain have converted him by theological disputations; but he
fell asleep listening to them.</p>
<p>Messire de Lumey being at table, full of wine and meat, a messenger
arrived from Gorcum, from Captain Marin, with a copy of letters from
the Silent, Prince of Orange, &ldquo;commanding all governors of cities
and other places to hold the ecclesiastics in like safeguard, safety,
and privilege as the rest of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger asked to be brought before de Lumey to give the copy
of the letters into his own hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the original?&rdquo; de Lumey asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my master,&rdquo; said the messenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the clown sends me the copy!&rdquo; said de Lumey.
&ldquo;Where is thy passport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said the messenger.</p>
<p>Messire de Lumey read it in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur and master Marin Brandt enjoins upon the
ministers, governors, and officers of the republic that they suffer to
pass safely,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>De Lumey, striking his fist on the table and tearing up the
passport:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is he meddling
with, this Marin, this trash, who had not, before the taking of Briele,
the backbone of a red herring to put between <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>his
teeth? He dubs himself monseigneur and master, and sends me his order.
He enjoins and ordains! Tell thy master that since he is so much
captain and monseigneur, and so much bidding and forbidding, the monks
shall be hanged high and short at once, and thou with them if thou dost
not take thyself off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And fetching him a kick, he sent him out of the chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me to drink,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Have you seen the
insolence of this Marin? I could spit out my breakfast with rage. Let
them hang the monks immediately in their barn, and bring me their
Flemish conductor, after he has seen their execution. We shall see if
he will dare to tell me I have done wrong. God&rsquo;s blood! what are
these jugs and glasses wanted here for still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he broke with a great crashing the cups and dishes, and no man
dared speak to him. The servants would have picked up the pieces; he
did not allow them, and drinking out of the flasks immoderately, he
became more and more angry, striding about and crushing the bits and
trampling on them furiously.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was brought before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;dost thou bring tidings of thy
friends the monks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are hanged,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;and a
cowardly executioner, killing them for hire, opened the belly and sides
of one of them after death, like a disembowelled pig, to sell the fat
to an apothecary. Word of a soldier is no longer word of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Lumey, trampling among the broken crockery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou bravest me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;four-foot rascal, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>thou, too, shalt be hanged, not in a barn, but
ignominiously on the open square, in the eyes of everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame upon you,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;shame upon
us: word of a soldier no longer word of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou hold thy tongue, mule!&rdquo; said Messire de
Lumey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame upon thee,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;word of a
soldier is no more word of gold. Punish rather the rascally vendors of
human fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Messire de Lumey, rushing on him, raised his hand to strike
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;I am thy prisoner,
but I have no fear of thee; word of a soldier is no more word of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messire de Lumey then drew his sword and would certainly have slain
Ulenspiegel if Messire de Tres-Long, holding back his arm, had not
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity! he is brave and valiant; he hath committed no
crime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Lumey, then controlling himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him ask pardon,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel, remaining upright:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him say at least that I was not wrong,&rdquo; cried de
Lumey, becoming furious.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel made answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not lick the boots of lords: word of a soldier is no
more word of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them erect the gallows,&rdquo; said de Lumey, &ldquo;and
let them bring him to it; that will be a hempen word for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;and I shall cry out in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>the presence of all the people: &lsquo;Word of a
soldier is no more word of gold!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gallows was set up on the great marketplace. The news ran
swiftly about the town that they were about to hang Ulenspiegel, the
valiant Beggar. And the people were moved with pity and compassion. And
they ran together in a crowd to the great market; Messire de Lumey came
thither also on horseback, wishing himself to give the signal for the
execution.</p>
<p>He looked with no mildness upon Ulenspiegel on the ladder, arrayed
for death, in his shirt, his arms tied to his body, his hands folded,
the rope about his neck, and the executioner ready to do his work.</p>
<p>Tres-Long said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, pardon him; he is no traitor, and no one ever
saw a man hanged because he was sincere and merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the men and women of the people, hearing Tres-Long speak, cried:
&ldquo;Pity, Monseigneur, grace and pity for Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mule-headed fellow braved me,&rdquo; said de Lumey:
&ldquo;let him repent and say I did right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou repent and say that he did right?&rdquo; said
Tres-Long to Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word of a soldier is no more word of gold,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on the rope,&rdquo; said de Lumey.</p>
<p>The executioner was about to obey; a young girl, all clad in white
and garlanded with flowers, ran up the stairs of the scaffold, leaped
on Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s neck, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is mine; I take him for my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the people applauded and the women cried out: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live, long live the girl who is Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s
saviour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Messire de Lumey.</p>
<p>Tres-Long answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the use and custom of the town, it is by right and law
that a young maiden and unmarried woman can save a man from the rope by
taking him for husband at the foot of the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is with him,&rdquo; said de Lumey; &ldquo;untie
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then riding up to the scaffold, he saw the girl prevented from
cutting Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s ropes and the executioner seeking to oppose
her efforts and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cut them, who will pay for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl paid no heed to him.</p>
<p>Seeing her so light, so loving, and so subtle, he was touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Nele, his betrothed,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I come
from Flanders to seek him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou didst well,&rdquo; said de Lumey in a naughty voice.</p>
<p>And he went away.</p>
<p>Tres-Long then coming up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fleming,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;once thou art married
wilt thou be a soldier still in our ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, Messire,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, girl, what wilt thou do without thy man?&rdquo;
Nele answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are willing, Messire, I will be fifer in his
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; said Tres-Long.</p>
<p>And he gave her two florins for the wedding feast.</p>
<p>And Lamme, weeping and laughing with pleasure, said: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are three florins more: we shall eat it all; I am
paying. Let us go to the Golden Comb. He is not dead, my friend. Long
live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the people applauded, and they went off to the Golden Comb,
where a great feast was ordered: and Lamme threw deniers to the people
out of the windows.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said to Nele:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling beloved, there thou art then beside me! Hurrah! She
is here, flesh, heart, and soul, my sweet friend. Oh! the sweet eyes
and lovely red lips whence there came never aught but kind words! She
saved my life, the dear beloved! Thou shalt play the fife of
deliverance on our ships. Dost thou remember ... but no.... Ours is the
present hour full of gladness, and mine thy face sweet as June flowers.
I am in paradise. But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou art
weeping....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have killed her,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>And she told him the tale of mourning.</p>
<p>And, looking on one another, they wept with love and grief.</p>
<p>And at the feast they drank and ate, and Lamme looked on them
woefully, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my wife, where art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the priest came and married Nele and Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>And the morning sun found them one beside the other in their bridal
bed.</p>
<p>And Nele lay with her head on Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s shoulder. And when
she awoke in the sunshine, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh face and sweet heart, we shall be the avengers of
Flanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, kissing him on the mouth: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild head and stout arms,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;God will
bless the fife and the sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make thee a soldier&rsquo;s garb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;but who said that
strawberries are good in the morning? Thy mouth is far
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and Nele had, like their friends
and comrades, taken from the convents the wealth gotten from the people
by the help of processions, feigned miracles, and other Roman
mummeries. This was against the orders of the Silent, the prince of
liberty, but the money helped with the charges of the war. Lamme
Goedzak, not content with providing himself with money, looted from out
the convents hams, sausages, flasks of beer and wine, and came back
from them joyously carrying across his breast a baldric of fowls,
geese, turkeys, capons, hens and pullets, and leading behind him on a
rope certain monastical calves and pigs. And this by right of war, said
he.</p>
<p>Rejoicing in each prize, he fetched it to the ship that there might
be revel and feast, but lamented all the same that the master cook was
so ignorant in the science of sauces and fricassees.</p>
<p>Now on that day the Beggars, having looked victoriously upon the
cup, said to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast thy nose always in the wind to smell out news of
terra firma; thou knowest all the adventures of the war: sing them to
us. And Lamme shall beat the drum the while and the pretty little fifer
shall squeal to the measure of thy song.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One bright cool day in May, Ludwig of Nassau, thinking to
enter into Mons, finds not his footmen nor his horse. A few trusty men
held a gate open and a drawbridge down, that he might have the town.
But the citizens seized the gate and the drawbridge. Where are the
soldiers of Count Louis? The citizens are about to hoist up the bridge.
Count Louis winds his horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel sang:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Where are thy footmen and thy horse?</p>
<p class="line">They are in the woods, treading all down:</p>

<p class="line">Master Sun makes all shine,</p>
<p class="line">Their ruddy warrior faces,</p>
<p class="line">The polished rumps of their horses;</p>
<p class="line">Count Ludwig winds his horn:</p>
<p class="line">They hear it. Softly beat the drum.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Full trot, bridle loose!</p>

<p class="line">Haste! haste! to the rescue!</p>
<p class="line">The bridge rises.... Send the spur</p>
<p class="line">Into the chargers&rsquo; bloody flanks.</p>
<p class="line">The bridge rises: The town is lost!</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;They are before it. Is it too late?</p>

<p class="line">The town is won! Do ye hear</p>

Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nele, smiling, made the fife squeal amain, and Lamme beat the
drum, and aloft, towards the sky, God&rsquo;s temple, there were raised
golden cups and hymns of liberty. And the waves, like sirens, bright
and cool about the ships, murmured in harmony.</p>

<p class="first">One day in the month of August, a hot and heavy day,
Lamme was plunged in melancholy. His jolly drum was dumb and sleeping,
and he had thrust the drumsticks into the mouth of his satchel.
Ulenspiegel and Nele, smiling with amorous delight, were warming
themselves in the sun: the look-out men stationed in the tops were
whistling or singing, searching over the wide ocean if they could not
see some prey on the horizon. Tr&egrave;s-Long kept questioning them;
they still replied: &ldquo;<i lang="nl">Niets</i>,&rdquo; nothing.</p>
<p>And Lamme, pale and broken down, sighed piteously. And Nele said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence cometh it, Lamme, that thou art so woebegone?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art growing thin, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I am woebegone and thin. My
heart loses its gaiety and my jolly face its freshness. Aye, laugh at
me, ye that have found one another again through a thousand perils.
Mock you at poor Lamme, who lives a widower, being married, while
she,&rdquo; said he, pointing to Nele, &ldquo;must needs tear her man
away from the kisses of the rope, his last lover. She did well, God be
praised; but let her not laugh at me. Aye, thou must not laugh at poor
Lamme, Nele, my dear. My wife laughs enough for ten. Alas, ye females,
ye are cruel towards others&rsquo; woes. Aye, I have a grieved heart,
stricken with the sword of desertion, and nothing will ever comfort it,
if not she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or some fricassee,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;where is the meat in this
miserable ship? On the king&rsquo;s vessels, they have meat four times
a week, if there be no fast, and fish three times. As for the fish, God
destroy me if this tow&mdash;I mean their flesh&mdash;does anything but
kindle my blood for nothing, my poor blood that will go to water before
long. They have beer, cheese, soup, and good drink. Aye! they have
everything for the comfort of their stomachs: biscuit, rye bread, beer,
butter, smoked meat, yea, all, dried fish, cheese, mustard seed, salt,
beans, peas, barley, vinegar, oil, tallow, wood, and coal. We, we have
just been forbidden to take the cattle of any so-ever, be he citizen,
abbot, or gentleman. We eat herrings and drink small beer. Alas! I have
nothing left now: neither love of women, nor good wine, nor <i lang=
"nl">dobbele-bruinbier</i>, nor good food. Where are our joys
here?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell thee, Lamme,&rdquo; answered Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;Eye for eye, tooth for tooth: at Paris, on Saint
Bartholomew&rsquo;s night, they killed ten thousand free hearts in
Paris city alone; the king himself shot at his folk. Awake, Fleming;
seize the axe without mercy: there are our joys; smite the Spaniard and
Roman enemy wherever thou shalt find him. Let be thy eatables. They
have taken the dead or living victims to their rivers, and by full
cartloads, and have flung them in the water. Dead or alive, dost thou
hear, Lamme? The Seine ran red for nine days, and the ravens settled
down in clouds upon the town. At La Charit&eacute;, at Rouen, Toulouse,
Lyons, Bordeaux, Bourges, Meaux, terrible was the massacre. Seest thou
the troops of dogs satiate with eating, lying beside the bodies? Their
teeth are tired. The flight of the ravens is heavy, so laden are their
stomachs with the flesh of the victims. Hearest thou, Lamme, the voice
of their spirits crying vengeance and pity? Awake, Fleming! Thou dost
speak of thy wife. I do not believe her unfaithful, but bereft of her
wits, and she loveth thee still, poor friend of mine: she was not among
those court ladies who on the very night of the massacre stripped the
bodies with their fine hands to see how great or how small were their
carnal members. And they laughed, these ladies great in lewdness.
Rejoice, my son, notwithstanding thy fish and thy small beer. If the
after taste of the herring is insipid, more insipid still is the smell
of this foulness. Those that slew took their meals, and with ill-washen
hands carved fat geese to offer the wings, legs, and rump to the
charming Paris damozels. They had but lately felt other meat, cold
meat.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will complain no more, my son,&rdquo; said Lamme, rising
up: &ldquo;the herring is ortolan; malvoisie is small beer to free
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said:</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On a black night the tempest growled in the depths of
the clouds. Ulenspiegel was on the deck of the ship with Nele, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All our lights are out. We are foxes, watching by night for
the passing of the Spanish poultry, which is to say their two and
twenty <i>assabres</i>, rich ships with lanterns burning, that will be
to them stars of ill fortune. And we shall rush upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This night is a witches&rsquo; night. This sky is black
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>as the mouth of hell; these lightnings gleam
like the smile of Satan; the distant thunderstorm is growling dully;
the sea-mews pass, uttering loud cries; the sea rolls its
phosphorescent waves like silver serpents. Thyl, my beloved, come into
the world of the spirits. Take the powder of vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I see the Seven, my darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they took the powder of vision.</p>
<p>And Nele shut Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s eyes, and Ulenspiegel shut
Nele&rsquo;s eyes. And they beheld a cruel spectacle.</p>
<p>Heaven, earth, sea were full of men, of women, of children, toiling,
wandering, journeying, or dreaming. The sea cradled them; the earth
carried them. And they swarmed like eels in a basket.</p>
<p>Seven men and women were in the middle of the firmament, seated upon
thrones, their brows girt with a brilliant star, but they were so
shadowy that Nele and Ulenspiegel could see only their stars with any
distinctness.</p>
<p>The sea rose up to the sky, tumbling in its foam the innumerable
multitude of ships whose masts and rigging clashed together,
interlocked, broke one another, crushed each other, following the
tempestuous moving of the waves. Then one ship appeared in the midst of
all the others. Its bottom was of flaming iron. Its keel was made of
steel shaped and sharpened like a knife. The water cried out, groaning,
when it went through. Death was upon the stern of the ship, seated,
grinning, holding his scythe in one hand and in the other a whip which
he smote upon seven personages. One was a man woebegone, thin, haughty,
silent. He held in one hand a sceptre and in the other a sword. Beside
him, mounted upon a goat, there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>was a ruddy girl, with bared
breast, her robe open, and a sprightly eye. She was stretched out
lasciviously beside an old Jew picking up bits of rubbish and a big
bloated fellow that fell down every time she set him on his feet, while
a thin and angry woman beat them both. The big man never avenged
himself nor did his red-faced she-companion. A monk in their midst was
eating sausages. A woman lying on the earth, was crawling like a
serpent among the others. She bit the old Jew because of his old
rubbish, the bloated man because he was too comfortable, the red woman
for the dewy brightness of her eyes, the monk for his sausage, and the
thin man because of his sceptre. And soon all of them fell
a-fighting.</p>
<p>When they passed, the battle was horrible on the sea, in the sky,
and on the earth. It rained blood. The ships were broken with blows of
axes, arquebuses, and cannon shot. The shattered fragments flew into
the air in the midst of the powder smoke. On the earth armies clashed
together like walls of bronze. Towns, villages, harvests burned amid
cries and tears: tall spires, stone lace-work, held up their proud
silhouettes in the midst of the fire, then fell down with a crash like
oak trees laid low. Black horsemen, numerous and close arrayed as bands
of ants, sword in hand, pistol in hand, were smiting men, women,
children. Some made holes in the ice and buried old men alive in them;
others cut off women&rsquo;s breasts and sprinkled pepper on the place;
others hanged children in the fireplaces. Those who were tired of
killing violated some girl or some woman; drank, played dice, and
tossing over piles of gold, the fruit of pillage, dabbled their red
fingers in it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Seven, crowned with stars, cried: &ldquo;Pity for the poor
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the phantoms grinned with laughter. And their voices were as the
voices of a thousand sea-eagles crying together. And Death brandished
his scythe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou hear them?&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;they are
the birds of prey of poor mankind. They live on small birds, which are
the simple and the good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Seven, crowned with stars, cried: &ldquo;Love, justice,
compassion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Seven phantoms laughed loudly. And their voices were like
the voices of a thousand sea-eagles crying all together. And Death
struck them with his whip.</p>
<p>And the ship passed over the sea, cutting in two boats, vessels,
men, women, children. On the sea re&euml;choed the plaints of the
victims crying: &ldquo;Pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the red ship passed over them all, while the phantoms, laughing,
cried like sea-eagles.</p>
<p>And Death, laughing loud, drank the water that was full of
blood.</p>
<p>And the ship having disappeared in the mist, the battle ceased, and
the Seven crowned with stars vanished away.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel and Nele saw nothing now save the black sky, the
surging sea, the dark clouds coming forward on the phosphorescent sea,
and close at hand, red stars.</p>
<p>These were the lanterns of the two and twenty <i>assabres</i>. The
sea and the thunder were growling dully and faintly.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel rang the bell for the <i>wacharm</i> softly, and
cried: &ldquo;The Spaniard, the Spaniard! He is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>sailing for Flessingue!&rdquo; And the cry was
repeated throughout the whole fleet.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said to Nele:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gray hue is spreading over the sky and over the sea. The
lanterns burn now but feebly; the dawn lifts, the wind is freshening,
the waves throw their spume over the decks of the ships; a thick rain
is falling and speedily ceases; the sun rises radiant, gilding the
crest of the waves: it is thy smile, Nele, fresh as the morning, sweet
as the sun&rsquo;s ray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two and twenty <i>assabres</i> pass: on the ships of the Beggars
the drums are beating, the fifes are squealing: de Lumey cries:
&ldquo;In the Prince&rsquo;s name, to the chase!&rdquo; Ewout Pietersen
Wort, sub-admiral, cries: &ldquo;In the name of Monseigneur
d&rsquo;Orange and the admiral, to the chase!&rdquo; On all the ships,
the <i>Johannah</i>, the <i>Swan</i>, <i>Anne-Mie</i>, the
<i>Beggar</i>, the <i>Compromise</i>, the <i>d&rsquo;Egmont</i>, the
<i lang="nl">de Hoorn</i>, on the <i lang="nl">Willem de Zwyger</i>
(the <i>William the Silent</i>,) all the captains cry: &ldquo;In the
name of Monseigneur d&rsquo;Orange and the admiral!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the chase! Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; cry the soldiers
and sailors. Tr&egrave;s-Long&rsquo;s <i>houlque</i>, on which are
Lamme and Ulenspiegel, and called <i>Briele</i>, followed closely by
the <i>Johannah</i>, the <i>Swan</i>, and the <i>Beggar</i>, take four
<i>assabres</i>. The Beggars fling everything Spanish into the sea,
make the inhabitants of the Low Countries prisoners, empty the ships
like eggshells, and leave them to float without masts or sails in the
roadstead. Then they pursue the other eighteen. The wind blows
violently; coming from Antwerp, the sides of the swift ships bend over
in the water of the river beneath the weight of the sails swollen like
a monk&rsquo;s cheeks in the wind that comes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>from
kitchens; the <i>assabres</i> go swiftly; the Beggars pursue them into
the very roadstead of Meddleburg under the fire from the forts. There a
bloody battle joins: the Beggars carrying axes rush on the decks of the
ships, soon strewn with lopped-off arms and legs, that have to be
thrown into the waves after the combat ends. The forts fire on them:
they take no heed, and to the shout of &ldquo;Long live the
Beggar!&rdquo; take from out the <i>assabres</i> powder, artillery,
bullets, and corn; burn the boats when they have emptied them; and make
off to Flessingue, leaving them smoking and flaming in the
roadsteads.</p>
<p>From there they will send squadrons to pierce the dykes of Zealand
and Holland, to help in the construction of fresh ships, and notably of
flyboats of one hundred and forty tons carrying up to twenty cannon of
cast iron.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the ships it is snowing. The air is all white as
far as eye can see, and the snow falls without ceasing, falls softly
upon the black water where it melts.</p>
<p>On the earth it is snowing: all white are the roadways, all white
the black silhouettes of the trees bereft of their leaves. No sound but
the distant bells of Haarlem striking the hour, and the gay chime
sending its muffled notes through the thick air.</p>
<p>Bells, ring not; bells, play not your sweet and simple airs: Don
Frederic draws near, the dukeling of blood. He is marching upon thee,
followed by thirty-five companies of Spaniards, thy mortal foes,
Haarlem, O thou city of liberty; twenty-two companies of Walloons,
eighteen companies of Germans, eight hundred horse, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>a
powerful artillery, all follow in his train. Hearest thou the clang of
this murderous iron on the wagons? Falconets, culverins, big-mouthed
mortars, all that is for thee, Haarlem. Bells, ring not; chimes, fling
not your gladsome notes into the air thickened with snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bells, we the bells, shall ring; I, the chime, I shall sing,
flinging my bold notes into the air thick with snow. Haarlem is the
town of hardy hearts, of brave women. Undaunted she sees, from her
topmost towers, the black masses of the butchers undulating like troops
of ants: Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and a hundred sea Beggars are within her
walls. Their fleet is cruising in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come!&rdquo; say the inhabitants; &ldquo;we are but
citizens, fishermen, sailors, and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of the Duke of Alba wanteth, he declares, no other
keys to come into our house than his cannon. Let him open, if he can,
these weak gates; he will find men behind them. Ring out, bells;
chimes, launch your glad notes into the air thick with snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have but weak walls and old-fashioned ditches. Fourteen
guns belch out their balls of forty-six pound on the
<i>Cruys-poort</i>. Put men where stones are lacking. Night comes,
every man toileth, it is as though the cannon had never been there. On
the <i>Cruys-poort</i> they have hurled six hundred and eighty shot; on
St. John&rsquo;s Gate six hundred and seventy-five. These keys do not
open, for there, behind, rises a new rampart. Ring out, bells; chimes,
hurl into the thick air your merry notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cannon beat, beat, beat ever on the walls; the stones
fly, the walls crumble. Wide enough is the breech to let a company pass
in abreast. The assault! &lsquo;Kill! Kill!&rsquo; they cry. They
mount, they are ten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266"
name="pb266">266</a>]</span>thousand; suffer them to pass the moats
with their bridges, with their ladders. Our cannon are ready. Lo, there
the flag of those that are to die. Salute them, cannon of liberty! They
salute: chain shot, balls of flaming tar flying and hissing, pierce,
cut, kindle, blind the assailing masses that fall back and flee in
disorder. Fifteen hundred dead lie in the ditch. Ring out, bells; and
ye, chimes, fling into the thickened air your merry notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back to the assault! They dare not. They fall to
shooting and sapping. We, too, we know the arts of the mine. Beneath
them, beneath them light the train; run, we shall see a goodly sight.
Four hundred Spaniards blown into the air. This is not the road of
eternal fires. Oh! the goodly dance to the silver sound of our bells,
to the merry music of our chimes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never suspect that the prince is watching over us; that
every day there come to us by ways well guarded sledges of corn and
gunpowder; the corn for us, the powder for them. Where are their six
hundred Germans that we slew and drowned in the Haarlem Wood? Where are
the eleven ensigns we have taken from them, the six pieces of
artillery, and the fifty oxen? We had one girdle of walls; now we have
two. Even the women fight, and Kennan leads their valiant band. Come,
butchers, march down our streets; the children will hamstring you with
their little knives. Ring out, bells; and ye, chimes, fling into the
thickened air your merry notes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fortune is not with us. The Beggars&rsquo; fleet is
beaten in the lake. They are beaten, the troops Orange had sent to our
help. It freezes, it freezes bitterly. No more help now. Then for five
months, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>a thousand against ten thousand, we hold out.
Now we must needs come to terms with the butchers. Will he listen to
any terms, this bloody dukeling who hath sworn our destruction? Let us
send out all our soldiers with their arms: they will pierce the enemy
bands. But the women are at the gates, fearing lest they be left to
guard the town alone. Bells, ring out no more; chimes, fling no more
into the air your merry notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is June; the hay is fragrant, the corn grows golden in
the sun, the birds are singing: we have been hungry for five months;
the town is in mourning; we shall all go forth from Haarlem, the
musketeers at the head to open up the way, the women, the children, the
magistrates behind, guarded by the infantry that watches at the breech.
A letter, a letter from the dukeling of blood! Is it death he
announces? Nay, it is life to all that are in the town. O unlooked-for
clemency; O lie, mayhap! Wilt thou still sing, O merry chime? They are
entering the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and Nele had donned the costume of the German
soldiers shut up with them, to the number of six hundred, in the
cloister of the Augustines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall die to-day,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel in a low tone to
Lamme.</p>
<p>And he clasped to his breast the dainty form of Nele all shivering
with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my wife, I shall never see her more,&rdquo; said Lamme.
&ldquo;But perhaps our costume as German soldiers will save our
lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel nodded his head to show he believed in no hope of
grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear no noise of pillage,&rdquo; said Lamme. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the terms, the townsfolk redeemed their lives, and the
town from pillage, for the sum of two hundred and forty thousand
florins. They must pay one hundred thousand florins down in twelve
days, and the rest three months after. The women have been ordered to
retire into the churches. They are about to begin the massacre, beyond
a doubt. Dost thou hear them nailing up the scaffolds and erecting the
gallows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! we are to die!&rdquo; said Nele; &ldquo;I am
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Lamme low to Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;the
dukeling of blood has said that being famished we shall be more docile
when we are brought out to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so hungry!&rdquo; said Nele.</p>
<p>That night soldiers came and distributed bread enough for six
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred Walloon soldiers have been hanged in the
marketplace,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;It will soon be your turn. There
was always a matrimony between the Beggars and the Gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next night they came again with their bread for six men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four high burgesses,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;have been
beheaded. Two hundred and forty-nine soldiers have been bound together
two by two and cast into the sea. The crabs will be fat this year. You
do not look well, you folk, since the seventh of July that saw you come
here. They are gluttons and drunkards, these dwellers in the Low
Countries; we Spaniards, we have enough with two figs for our
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why, then,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;you
must needs, everywhere in the townsfolks&rsquo; houses, have four meals
of meats, poultry, creams, wines, and preserves; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>that
ye must have milk to wash the bodies of your <i>mustachos</i> and wine
to bathe your horses&rsquo; feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the eighteenth of July, Nele said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet are wet; what is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>At night the soldiers came again with their bread for six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the rope is no longer enough,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;the sword does the work. Three hundred soldiers and twenty-seven
burghers who tried to flee out of the town are now walking about the
streets of hell with their heads in their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the blood came again into the cloister; the soldiers
came not to bring the bread, but merely to contemplate the prisoners,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five hundred Walloons, Englishmen, and Scotsmen that were
beheaded yesterday looked better. These are hungry, no doubt, but who
then should die of hunger if not the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, they were like phantoms, all pale, haggard, broken,
trembling with cold ague.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth of August, at five in the evening, the soldiers
came in laughing and gave them bread, cheese, and beer. Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the feast of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock four companies came; the captains had the doors
of the cloister opened, ordering the prisoners to march four abreast
behind fifes and drums, to the place where they would be told to halt.
Certain streets were red, and they marched towards the Gallows
Field.</p>
<p>Here and there shallow pools of blood defiled the meadows; there was
blood all about the walls. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270"
href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>ravens came in clouds on
every hand; the sun hid in a bed of mists; the sky was still clear, and
in its depths awoke the shy stars. Suddenly they heard lamentable
howlings.</p>
<p>The soldiers said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They that are crying there are the Beggars of the Fuycke
Fort, without the town; they are being left to die of
hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, too,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;we are going to die.&rdquo;
And she wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lamme in Flemish&mdash;for the soldiers of
the escort understood not that proud speech&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
said Lamme, &ldquo;if I could catch that duke of blood and make him
eat, until his skin burst, each and all ropes, gallows, torture
benches, wooden horses, weights, and boots; if I could make him drink
the blood he has shed, if there came out of his torn skin and opened
bowels splinters of wood and pieces of iron, and still he did not give
up the ghost, I would tear out his heart from his breast and make him
eat it raw and poisoned. Then for certain would he fall from life to
death into the sulphur pit, where may the devil make him eat it and eat
it again without ceasing. And thus through all long
eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel and Nele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dost thou see naught?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see in the west,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;five men and two
women seated in a circle. One is clad in purple and wears a crown of
gold. He seems the chief over the rest, all ragged and tattered. I see
from the east another band of seven coming: one commands them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>also who is clad in purple, without a crown. And
they come against those of the west. And they fight against them in the
clouds, but I see nothing more now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seven,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;near by us in the foliage, a
voice like a breath of wind saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;By war and fire</p>
<p class="line">By pikes and swords</p>
<p class="line xd20e344">Seek;</p>
<p class="line">In death and blood</p>
<p class="line">Ruins and tears.</p>
<p class="line xd20e344">Find.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Others than we shall deliver the land of
Flanders,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;Night grows black, the
soldiers are lighting torches. We are near the Gallows Field. O sweet
beloved, why didst thou follow me? Dost thou hear nothing more,
Nele?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;a noise of arms among the corn.
And there, above that ridge, surmounting the way in which we are
entering, seest thou the red light of the torches gleam upon steel? I
see sparks of fire gleaming upon the matches of arquebuses. Are our
guardians asleep, or are they blind? Dost thou hear that clap of
thunder? Seest thou the Spaniards fall pierced with bullets? Hearest
thou &lsquo;Long live the Beggar!&rsquo;? They climb the path running,
musket in hand; they come down with axes all along the slope. Long live
the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; cry Lamme and Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;here are soldiers that give us
arms. Take, Lamme, take, my beloved. Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; cry the whole troop of
prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arquebuses cease not from firing,&rdquo; said Nele,
&ldquo;they fall like flies, lit up as they are by the light of the
torches. Long live the Beggars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; cry the band of rescuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; cry Ulenspiegel and the
prisoners. &ldquo;The Spaniards are in a ring of fire. Kill! kill!
There is not one left on his feet. Kill! no pity, war without mercy.
And now let us be off and run to Enckhuyse. Who hath the
butchers&rsquo; clothes of cloth and silk? Who hath their
weapons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All! all!&rdquo; they cry. &ldquo;Long live the
Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, they went off for Enckhuyse by boat, and there the
Germans delivered with them remained to guard the town.</p>
<p>And Lamme, Nele, and Ulenspiegel found their ships again. And lo
once more they are singing upon the free sea: &ldquo;Long live the
Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they cruise in the roadstead of Flessingue.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once again was Lamme joyous. He was always ready
to go on shore, hunting oxen, sheep, and fowl like hares, stags, and
ortolans.</p>
<p>And he was not alone in this nourishing hunting. Good was it then to
see the huntsmen return, Lamme at their head, dragging the big beasts
by the horns, driving the small cattle before them, directing flocks of
geese with long wands, and carrying slung from their boathooks hens,
pullets, and capons in spite of their struggling. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then it was revel and feasting on the ships. And Lamme would say:
&ldquo;The fragrance of the sauces mounts up to the very sky, there
delighting their worships the angels, which say: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the
best part of the meat&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were cruising there came a fleet of merchantmen from
Lisbon, whose commander knew not that Flessingue had fallen into the
hands of the Beggars. It is ordered to cast anchor; it is hemmed round.
Long live the Beggar! Drums and fifes sound the signal for boarding;
the merchants have guns, pikes, hatchets, arquebuses.</p>
<p>Musket balls and cannon balls rain from the ships of the Beggars.
Their musketeers, entrenched round about the main mast in their wooden
forts, fire with deadly aim, without any danger. The merchants fall
like flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the rescue!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel to Lamme and to Nele,
&ldquo;to the rescue! Here be spices, knicknacks, precious dainties,
sugar, nutmegs, cloves, ginger, reals, ducats, <i>moutons
d&rsquo;or</i> all bright and shining. There are more than five hundred
thousand pieces in coin. The Spaniard will pay the cost of the war.
Drink ho! Let us sing the Beggars&rsquo; Mass, which is
battle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel and Lamme rushed everywhere like lions. Nele played
the fife, sheltered in the wooden castle. The whole of the fleet was
taken.</p>
<p>The dead were counted and these were a thousand on the side of the
Spaniards, three hundred on the side of the Beggars: among them was the
master cook of the fly boat <i>La Briele</i>.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel asked to be allowed to speak before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>Tr&egrave;s-Long and the sailors: this
Tr&egrave;s-Long granted with a good will. And he said to them as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master captain and ye comrades, we have but now inherited
much spices, and here is Lamme, the good belly, who findeth that the
poor dead man there, God have him in joy, was in no wise a doctor great
enough in fricassees. Let us name him in the place of the dead. And he
will prepare you divine stews and paradisaic soups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said Tr&egrave;s-Long and the others;
&ldquo;Lamme shall be the master cook of the ship. He shall bear the
great wooden ladle to skim the froth off his sauces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire Captain, comrades and friends,&rdquo; said Lamme,
&ldquo;ye behold me weeping with joy, for I deserve not so great
honour. Nevertheless, since ye deign to call upon my worthlessness, I
accept the noble functions of master of arts in fricassees upon the
stout fly boat <i>La Briele</i>, but with a humble prayer to you that
ye invest me with the supreme command of the kitchen work, in such
fashion that your master cook&mdash;the which will be myself&mdash;may
by right law and might be empowered to prevent anyonesoever from coming
and eating another&rsquo;s share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tr&egrave;s-Long and the others cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live Lamme! thou shalt have right, law, and
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have another prayer to make
before you in all humility: I am a fat man, big and strong; deep is my
paunch, deep my stomach; my poor wife&mdash;may God restore her to
me&mdash;always gave me two portions instead of one: accord me this
same favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tr&egrave;s-Long, Ulenspiegel, and the sailors said: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt have the two portions, Lamme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme, suddenly fallen melancholy, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, my sweet darling! if anything can console me for thy
absence, it will be to bring again to mind in my duties thy heavenly
cooking in our sweet home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take the oath, my son,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;Let the great wooden ladle and the great copper caldron be
brought hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; quoth Lamme, &ldquo;by God, may he be here my
helper, I swear fidelity to Monseigneur the Prince of Orange, called
the Silent, governing the provinces of Holland and Zealand for the
king; fidelity to Messire de Lumey, the admiral commanding our gallant
fleet, and to Messire Tr&egrave;s-Long, vice-admiral and captain of the
good ship <i>La Briele</i>; I swear to dress at my poor best, according
to the use and wont of the great cooks of old, which have left behind
them noble books with cuts upon the great art of cookery, what flesh
and fowl Fortune shall accord to us; I swear to feed the said Messire
Tr&egrave;s-Long, our captain, his second in command, which is my
friend, Ulenspiegel, and all you, master mariner, pilot, boatswain,
companions, soldiers, gunners, captain&rsquo;s page, chirurgeon,
trumpeteer, sailors, and all others. If the roast is too underdone, the
fowl unbrowned; if the soup sends up an insipid fragrance, inimical to
all good digestion; if the steam of the sauces doth not entice you all
to rush into the kitchen&mdash;always with my good will; if I make you
not all sprightly and well favoured, I will resign my noble functions,
judging myself unfit longer to occupy the throne of the kitchen. So may
God help me in this life and in the next.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the master cook,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;the king
of the kitchen, the emperor of fricassees. He shall have three portions
instead of two on Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme became master cook of the ship <i>La Briele</i>. And while
the succulent soups were simmering in the saucepans, he stood at the
door of the galley, proudly holding his great wooden ladle like a
sceptre.</p>
<p>And he had his treble rations on Sundays.</p>
<p>When the Beggars came to grips with the enemy, he would stay
preferably in his sauce laboratory but would come out every now and
then to run up on the deck and fire a few rounds. Then he would hurry
down again at once to keep an eye to his sauces.</p>
<p>Thus being trusty cook and valiant soldier, he was well beloved of
all.</p>
<p>But no one must penetrate the sanctuary of his galley. For then he
was even like a devil and with his wooden ladle he smote them
pitilessly hip and thigh.</p>
<p>And thenceforth he was called Lamme the Lion.</p>

<p>White for freedom, blue for great heart, orange for the prince,

<p>All sails set! all sails set, the stout ships; the billows beat upon

<p>Boyers and croust&egrave;ves, flat-bottomed boats, slide along the
river. The waters groan as they are cloven through, when the ships go

<p class="first">The king of blood learned the news of their victories.
Death was already gnawing at the murderer and his body was full of
worms. He would walk about the corridors of Valladolid, sullen and
savage, dragging heavily his swollen feet and leaden legs. He never
sang, the cruel tyrant; when the day came, he never laughed, and when
the sun lighted up his empire like a smile from God he felt no joy in
his heart.</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel, Lamme, and Nele sang like birds, risking their
hide, that is to say Lamme and Ulenspiegel, their white skin, to wit
Nele, living from day to day, and finding more joy in one death fire
quenched by the Beggars than the dark king had in the burning of a
town. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

<p>At this time, too, William the Silent, Prince of Orange, broke from
his rank as admiral Messire de Lumey de la Marck, by reason of his
great cruelties. He appointed Messire Bouwen Ewoutsen Worst in his
stead. He took measures also to pay for the grain taken by the Beggars
from the peasants, to restore the forced contributions levied upon
them, and to grant the Roman Catholics, like all others, the free
exercise of their religion, without either persecution or insult.</p>

<p class="first">On the ships of the Beggars, under the dazzling sky,
over the shining waves, squealed the fifes; droned bagpipes, gurgled
flasks, chimed glasses, and shone the steel of weapons and armour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;let us beat the drum of
glory, let us beat the drum of joy. Long live the Beggar! Spain is
conquered; the ghoul is beaten down. Ours is the sea, Briele is taken.
Ours the coast as far as Nieuport, beyond Ostende and Blanckenberghe,
the islands of Zealand, the mouths of the Scheldt, the mouths of the
Meuse, the Rhine mouths as far as Helder. Ours are Texel, Vlieland,
Ter-Schelling, Ameland, Rottum, Borkum. Long live the Beggar!</p>

The harvest is ripe for the sickle. Long live the Beggar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours the Noord-Zee, the wide North Sea. Ours are good guns,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The world was then in the wolf month, which is the
month of December. A thin sharp rain was falling like needles upon the
sea. The Beggars were cruising in the Zuyderzee. Messire the Admiral
summoned by trumpet the captains of <i>houlques</i> and flyboats on
board his ship, and with them Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Admiral, addressing himself first of all
to Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;the Prince is minded to recognize thy good
devoirs and trusty services, and names thee as captain of the ship
<i>La Briele</i>. Herewith I hand thee the commission engrossed upon
parchment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All thanks to you, Messire Admiral,&rdquo; replied
Ulenspiegel: &ldquo;I shall be captain with all my little power, and
thus captaining I have great hope, if God help me, to uncaptain Spain
from the lands of Flanders and Holland: I mean from the Zuid and the
Noord-Neerlande.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said the admiral. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;
he added, speaking to them all, &ldquo;I will tell you that the folk of
Catholic Amsterdam are going to besiege Enckhuyse. They have not yet
come out from the Y canal; let us cruise about in front that they may
stay inside there and fall on each and all of their ships that may show
their tyrannical carcases in the Zuyderzee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made answer: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281"
name="pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We will knock holes in them. Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, returned to his ship, called his soldiers and his
sailors together on the deck, and told them what the admiral had
decided.</p>
<p>They replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have wings, the which are our sails; skates, which are the
keels of our ships; and giant hands, which are the grapples for
boarding. Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fleet set forth and cruised in front of Amsterdam a sea league
away, in such a sort that none could enter or come out against their
will.</p>
<p>On the fifth day the rain ceased; the wind blew sharper in the clear
sky; the Amsterdam folk made no stir.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ulenspiegel saw Lamme come up on deck, driving before him
with great blows of his wooden ladle the ship&rsquo;s <i>truxman</i>, a
young man skilful in the French and Flemish tongues, but more skilful
still in the science of the teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-for-naught,&rdquo; said Lamme, beating him, &ldquo;didst
thou deem thou couldst scatheless eat my fricassees before their due
time? Go up to the masthead and see if aught budges on the ships of
Amsterdam. Doing this thou wilt do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the <i>truxman</i> answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou think,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;to be paid without
doing the work? Thieves&rsquo; spawn, if thou dost not climb, I shall
have thee flogged. And thy French shall not save thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a beauteous tongue,&rdquo; said the
<i>truxman</i>, &ldquo;a tongue for love and war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he climbed the mast. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href=
"#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! lazybones?&rdquo; asked Lamme.</p>
<p>The <i>truxman</i> answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see naught in the town nor on the ships.&rdquo; And
descending:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now pay me,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep what thou hast stolen,&rdquo; replied Lamme; &ldquo;but
such gains are no profit; thou wilt doubtless vomit it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>truxman</i>, climbing again to the masthead, cried out
suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme! Lamme! there is a thief going into the
galley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the key in my pouch,&rdquo; rejoined Lamme.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then, taking Lamme apart, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, this great tranquillity of Amsterdam affrights me.
They have some hidden project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;The water is
freezing in the jugs in the cupboard; the fowl are like wood; hoar
frost whitens the sausages; the butter is a stone, the oil is all
white, the salt is dry as sand in the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a frost at hand,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
&ldquo;They will come in great numbers to attack us with
artillery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going on board the admiral&rsquo;s ship, he told his fear to the
admiral, who answered him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind blows from England: there will be snow, but it will
not freeze: go back to your ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel went away.</p>
<p>That night heavy snow fell; but soon, the wind blowing out of
Norway, the sea froze and was like a floor. The admiral beheld the
sight.</p>
<p>Then fearing lest the Amsterdam folk might come over the ice to burn
the ships, he bade the soldiers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>make ready their skates, in
case they might have to fight around and away from the ships, and the
gunners of the iron guns and the brass to pile up heaps of cannon-balls
by the gun carriages, to load the pieces, and to keep the portfires
always well lighted.</p>
<p>But the Amsterdam folk never came.</p>
<p>And so it was for seven days.</p>
<p>Towards evening on the eighth day Ulenspiegel gave orders that a
good feast should be served to the sailors and men at arms, to make
them a cuirass against the sharp wind that was blowing.</p>
<p>But Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing at all left now but biscuit and small
beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill
be Lenten revelry until the hour of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will not strike soon,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;The
Amsterdammers will come to burn us our ships, but not on this night.
First they must needs assemble themselves together around fires, and
there drink many a measure of wine mulled with Madeira sugar&mdash;may
God give us thereof&mdash;then having talked till midnight with
patience, logic, and full stoups, they will decide that there are
grounds for coming to a decision to-morrow as to whether they shall
attack or not attack next week. To-morrow, again drinking wine mulled
with Madeira sugar&mdash;may God give you thereof&mdash;they will
decide anew with calm, patience, and full stoups, that they must
assemble together another day, to the end that they may know if the ice
can or cannot bear a great band of men. And they will have it proved
and essayed by men of learning, who will lay down their conclusions
upon parchment. Having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>received which, they will know
that the ice is half an ell in thickness, and that it is solid enough
to bear some hundreds of men with field guns and artillery. Then
assembling themselves together once more to deliberate with calm,
patience, and many stoups of mulled wine, they will debate whether, by
reason of the treasure seized by us from the men of Lisbon, it is more
suitable to assault or to burn our ships. And being thus perplexed, but
temporizers, they will none the less decide that they must capture and
not burn our ships, notwithstanding the great wrong and hurt they would
do us by that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say well,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;but see you
not those fires kindle up within the town, and folk bearing lanterns
running busily about there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis because they are cold,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>And he added, sighing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is eaten. No more beef, pork, nor poultry; no more
wine, alas! nor good <i lang="nl">dobbel-bier</i>, nothing but biscuit
and small beer. Let who loves me follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither goest thou?&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;No man
may go from the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;thou art captain and master
as now. I will never go from the ship if thou dost forbid it. Yet deign
to consider that we ate the last of our sausage on the day before
yesterday: and that in this stern weather the fire of the kitchen is
the sun of good companions. Who would not fain smell here the odour of
sauces; sniff up the fragrant bouquet of the divine drink made of those
joyous blossoms that are gaiety, laughter, and good will to every man?
And so, captain and trusty friend, I dare say this: I devour
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>my very soul, since I eat naught, I who, though
loving but repose, never slaying by my will, save it were a tender
goose, a fat chicken, a succulent turkey, follow thee amid fatigue and
battles. See from here the lights in that rich farm well furnished of
big and little cattle. Knowest thou who it is that dwelleth there? It
is the boatman of Frisia, that betrayed Messire Dandelot and
furthermore brought to Enckhuyse, while it was still in
D&rsquo;Alba&rsquo;s hand, eighteen poor lords our friends, the which,
of his doing, were beheaded on the Horse Market at Brussels. This
traitor, who hath to name Slosse, got from the duke two thousand
florins for his treachery. With the price of that blood, a very Judas,
he purchased the farm thou seest there, and his great cattle and the
fields around about, which bearing fruit and increasing, I mean land
and herds, make him rich as now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart. Thou makest the hour of God to
strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;the hour of food in like wise.
Give me twenty lads, valiant soldiers and sailors; I will go and seek
out the traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be their leader,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;Who
loves justice let him follow me. Not all of you, dear friends and
trusty; there must be twenty only, else who would keep the ship? Draw
lots by the dice. Ye are twenty, come. The dice speak well. Put your
skates on your feet and glide towards the star of Venus burning bright
above the treachour&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guiding yourselves by the clear beam, come, ye twenty,
skating and sliding, axe on shoulder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind whistles and drives white whirls of snow before it
on the ice. Come, brave men!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye sing not, nor speak; ye go straight on, in silence,
towards the star; your skates make the ice complain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that falls picks himself up at once. We touch the shore;
no human shape on the white snow, not a bird in the icy air. Take off
the skates from your feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are on land; here are the meadows; put on your skates
again. We are round about the farm, holding our breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel knocks on the door; dogs bark. He knocks again, a window
opens and the <i>baes</i> says, sticking out his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sees but Ulenspiegel only: the others are concealed behind the
<i>keet</i>, which is the washhouse.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel makes answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire de Boussu bids thee betake thee to him at Amsterdam
upon the instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is thy safe-conduct?&rdquo; said the man, coming down
and opening the door to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel, showing him the twenty
Beggars who hurl themselves behind him into the opening.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel then says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art Slosse, the traitor boatman that brought into an
ambuscade Messires Dandelot, de Battenberg, and other lords. Where is
the price of their blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer replies, trembling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are the Beggars; grant me a pardon; I knew not what I did.
I have no money here within; I will give all I have.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is black dark; give us candles of tallow or of
wax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>baes</i> replies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tallow candles are hanging there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A candle being lit, said one of the Beggars, in the hearthplace:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is cold; let us kindle a fire. Here are proper
faggots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he pointed out upon a shelf flower pots in which withered and
dried plants might be seen.</p>
<p>He took one by the stalk and shaking it with the pot, the pot fell,
scattering over the ground ducats, florins, and reals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the treasure,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the other
flower pots.</p>
<p>In very deed, having emptied them, they found ten thousand
florins.</p>
<p>Seeing which, the <i>baes</i> cried out and wept.</p>
<p>The farm servants, both men and maids, came to the cries, in shirts
and smocks. The men wishing to avenge their master, were bound. Soon
the shamefaced women, and especially the younger, hid behind the
men.</p>
<p>Then Lamme went forward and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traitor farmer, where are the keys of the cellar, the
stables, the cowshed, and the sheep-pens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infamous pillagers,&rdquo; said the <i>baes</i>, &ldquo;ye
shall be hanged until ye are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the hour of God; give up the keys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will avenge me,&rdquo; said the <i>baes</i>, handing them
over to him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having emptied the farm, the Beggars departed skating towards the
ships, those light dwelling places of freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master cook am I,&rdquo; said Lamme, guiding them;
&ldquo;Master cook am I. Push along the gallant sledges laden with
wines and beer; drive on before you, by their horns, or by anything,
horses, oxen, swine, sheep, and flocks singing their native songs. The
pigeons coo in the baskets; the capons, stuffed with crumb, are
astonied in their wooden cages wherein they cannot budge. I am master
cook. The ice cries out beneath the steel of the skates. We are at the
ships. To-morrow there will be kitchen music. Let down the pulleys; put
girths on the horses, cows, and oxen. &rsquo;Tis a noble sight to see
them thus pendent by their bellies; to-morrow we shall be hanging by
the tongue to fat fricassees. The crane hoists them up into the ship.
These be carbonadoes. Throw me them pell mell into the hold, hens,
geese, ducks, capons. Who will wring their necks? The master cook. The
door is locked, I have the key in my satchel. Praised be God in the
kitchen! Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ulenspiegel went on board the admiral&rsquo;s ship taking with
him Dierick Slosse and the other prisoners, moaning and weeping for
terror of the rope.</p>
<p>Messire Worst came at the noise: perceiving Ulenspiegel&mdash;his
companions lit up by the red glare of the torches:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you of us?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This night we took, in his farm, the traitor Dierick Slosse,
that brought the eighteen into an ambuscade. This is the man. The
others are innocent menservants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"
href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>and maidservants. Then
handing him a satchel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These florins,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;were flourishing in
flower pots in the traitor&rsquo;s house: there are ten
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messire Worst said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye did ill to leave your ship; but because of your good
success pardon shall be granted to you. Welcome be the prisoners and
the satchel of florins, and ye, gallant men, to whom I assign, after
the laws and customs of the sea, a third of the prize: the second will
be for the fleet, and another third for Monseigneur d&rsquo;Orange;
string me up the traitor incontinent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beggars having obeyed, they opened afterward a hole in the ice
and threw the body of Dierick Slosse into it.</p>
<p>Messire Worst then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has grass sprung up around the ships that I hear hens
cackling, sheep bleating, cows and oxen lowing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the prisoners of our teeth,&rdquo; answered
Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;they will pay ransom of fricassees. Messire Admiral
shall have the choicest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for these folk, the knaves and the maidservants, among
whom are sprightly and pretty women, I will fetch them back aboard my
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having done so, he addressed them as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodfellows and goodwives, ye are here upon the best ship in
the world. Here we pass our time in jollity, feast, and revel without
end. If it please you to depart herefrom, pay ransom; if it please you
to stay here, ye shall live like us, toiling hard and eating well. As
for these dear women, I accord them, with the admiral&rsquo;s sanction,
full freedom of their persons, giving them to know that it is all one
to me whether they are fain to keep to their lovers that came upon the
ship with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>them or to make their choice of some stout
Beggar here present in order to bear him conjugal company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fair women were all faithful to their lovers, save only one,
who, smiling and looking upon Lamme, asked him if he would have
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All thanks, dear one,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I am
otherwise bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is married, poor fellow,&rdquo; said the Beggars, seeing
the girl vexed.</p>
<p>But she, turning her back on Lamme, chose another who like him had a
good round belly and a good round face.</p>
<p>That day and the following days there were great revels and
feastings on board with wines, fowl, and meats. And Ulenspiegel
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live the Beggar! Blow, sharp wintry winds, we will warm
the air with our hot breath. Our heart is afire for freedom of
conscience; our stomachs on fire for the enemy&rsquo;s meats. Drink we
wine, the milk of men. Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele, too, drank from a great golden tankard, and ruddy in the
breath of the wind, played the shrill fife. And for all the cold, the
Beggars ate and drank rejoicing on the deck.</p>

<p class="first">Suddenly the whole fleet perceived upon the bank a
black troop among which torches shone and the gleaming of arms; then
the torches were put out, and a great darkness reigned.</p>
<p>The admiral&rsquo;s orders being sent round, the alarm was given on
the ships, and all fires were quenched; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>sailors and soldiers
lay flat on the decks, armed with axes. The gallant gunners, linstock
in hand, watched by the guns loaded with bags of bullets and with chain
shot. As soon as the admiral and the captains should call out &ldquo;A
hundred paces!&rdquo;&mdash;which denoted the enemy&rsquo;s distance,
they were to fire from the bows, the poop, or the broadside, according
to their position in the ice.</p>
<p>And Messire Worst&rsquo;s voice was heard saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death to whoever speaks aloud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the captains said after him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death to whoever speaks aloud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was moonless, filled with stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou hear?&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel to Lamme, in a voice
like a whispering ghost. &ldquo;Hearest thou the voices of the
Amsterdammers, and the steel of their skates ringing over the ice? They
come swiftly. We can hear them speak. They are saying &lsquo;The lazy
Beggars are asleep. Ours is the Lisbon treasure!&rsquo; They are
lighting torches. Seest thou their ladders for the assault, their ugly
faces, and the long line of their band deployed for the attack? There
are a thousand of them, and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred paces!&rdquo; cried Messire Worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred paces!&rdquo; cried the captains all.</p>
<p>And there was a great noise like thunder, and lamentable outcries
upon the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty guns are thundering all together!&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;They are fleeing! Seest thou the torches vanishing
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pursue them!&rdquo; said Admiral Worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pursue them!&rdquo; said the captains.</p>
<p>But the pursuit did not last long, the fugitives having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>a
start of a hundred paces, and the legs of frightened hares.</p>
<p>And on the men that were crying out and dying on the ice were found
gold, jewels, and ropes for the Beggars.</p>
<p>And after this victory the Beggars said one to another:
&ldquo;<i lang="nl">Als God met ons is, wie tegen ons zal
zijn.</i><a id="xd20e7757" name="xd20e7757"></a> If God is with us, who
shall be against us? Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now on the morning of the third day thereafter Messire Worst was
uneasy, and looked for a fresh attack. Lamme leaped upon the deck and
said to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch me to this admiral that would not listen to you when
you prophesied a frost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go without any fetching you?&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Lamme departed, first locking the door of his galley. The admiral
was on deck, straining his eyes to see if he did not perceive some
movement from the city.</p>
<p>Lamme came up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur Admiral,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may a humble
master cook give you a rede?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, my son,&rdquo; said the admiral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;the water is thawing
in the jugs; the fowl grow soft again; the sausage is laying aside its
mildew of hoar frost; the butter becomes unctuous, the oil liquid; the
salt is weeping. It will rain before long, and we shall be saved,
Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked Messire Worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Lamme Goedzak,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the master cook
of the ship <i>La Briele</i>. And if all those great savants that boast
themselves astronomers read in the stars as true as I read in my
sauces, they could tell us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>that to-night there will be a thaw
with a great hubbub of storm and hail: but the thaw will not
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme went back to Ulenspiegel, to whom he said, towards
noon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a prophet already; the sky grows black, the wind
breathes stormily: a warm rain is falling; already there is a foot of
water upon the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At night he cried, rejoicing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Sea is swollen: &rsquo;tis the hour of the flood
tide; the high waves rolling into the Zuyderzee break up the ice, which
splinters in great fragments and leaps up on the ships; it flashes
sparkles of light; here comes the hail. The admiral bids us to withdraw
from before Amsterdam, and that with as much water as our greatest ship
can draw. Here we are in the harbour of Enckhuyse. The sea is freezing
afresh. I am a fine prophet, and it is a miracle from God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink we to Him, and blessings on Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the winter passed, and summer came.</p>

<p class="first">In mid-August, when hens, fed full with grain, remain
deaf to the call of the cock trumpeting his loves, Ulenspiegel said to
his sailors and soldiers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke of blood, being at Utrecht, dares there to issue a
blessed edict, promising among other gracious gifts, hunger, death,
ruin to the inhabitants of the Low Countries who might be unwilling to
submit. Everything that still remains whole, saith he, shall be
exterminate, and His Majesty the king will people the country with
strangers. Bite, duke, bite! The file <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>breaketh the
viper&rsquo;s tooth; we are files. Long live the Beggar!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alba, blood maketh thee drunk! Deemest thou that we would
fear thy threats or believe in thy clemency? Thy famous regiments whose
praises thou didst sing throughout the whole world, thy
<i>Invincibles</i>, thy <i>Tels Quels</i>, thy <i>Immortals</i>,
remained seven months bombarding Haarlem, a feeble city defended by
mere citizens; like mortal common men they danced in air the dance of
the bursting mines. Mere citizens besmeared them with tar; in the end
they were glorious victors, slaughtering the disarmed. Hearest thou,
murderer, the hour of God that striketh now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haarlem hath lost her splendid defenders, her stones sweat
blood. She hath lost and expended in her siege twelve hundred and
eighty thousand florins. The bishop is reinstated there; with light
hand and joyful countenance he blesses the churches; Don Frederick is
present at these consecrations; the bishop washes for him those hands
that in God&rsquo;s eyes are red and he communicates in two kinds,
which is not permitted to the poor common herd. And the bells ring out
and the chime flings into the air its calm, harmonious notes; it is
like the singing of angels over a cemetery. An eye for an eye! A tooth
for a tooth! Long live the Beggar!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The Beggars were then at Flushing, where Nele caught
fever. Forced to leave the ship, she was lodged at the house of one
Peeters, of the Reformed faith, at Turven-Key.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, deeply grieving, was yet rejoiced, thinking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>that in this bed where she would doubtless be
healed the Spanish bullets could not reach her.</p>
<p>And with Lamme he was always beside her, tending her well and loving
her better. And there they used to talk together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend and true comrade,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel one day,
&ldquo;dost thou not know the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my son,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seest thou the flyboat that but late came to join our fleet,
and knowest thou who it is upon it that twangs the viol every
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the late colds,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I am as one
deaf in both ears. Why dost thou laugh, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ulenspiegel, continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I heard her sing a Flemish
<i>lied</i> and found her voice was sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;she, too, sang and played
upon the viol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou know the other news?&rdquo; went on
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know naught of it, my son,&rdquo; said Lamme.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel made answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have our orders to drop down the Scheldt with our ships as
far as Antwerp, to find there the enemy ships to take or burn. As for
the men, no quarter. What thinkest thou of this, big paunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;shall we never hear aught
else in this distressful land save burnings, hangings, drownings, and
other ways of exterminating poor men? When then will blessed peace
come, that we can in quiet roast partridges, fricassee chickens, and
make the puddings sing in the pan among the eggs? I like the black ones
best; the white are too rich.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This sweet time will come,&rdquo; replied Ulenspiegel,
&ldquo;when in the orchards of Flanders we see on apple, plum, pear
trees and cherry trees, a Spaniard hanged on every bough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;if only I could find my wife
again, my so dear, so sweet, beloved soft darling faithful wife! For
know it well, my son, cuckold I was not nor shall ever be; she was too
sober and calm in her ways for that; she eschewed the company of other
men; if she loved fair and fine array, it was but for woman&rsquo;s
need. I was her cook, her kitchenman, her scullion, I am glad to say
it, why am I it not once more? but I was her master as well and her
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us end this talk,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel. &ldquo;Hearest
thou the admiral calling: &lsquo;Up anchors!&rsquo; and captains after
him calling the same? We must needs weigh soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou go so quickly?&rdquo; said Nele to
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to the ships,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without me?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou not think,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how lying here I
shall be distressed for thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;my skin is made of
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art mocking,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I see nothing on
thee but thy doublet, which is cloth, not iron; beneath it is thy body,
made of bone and flesh, like my own. If they wound thee, who will heal
thee? Art thou to die all alone in the midst of the fighters? I shall
go with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the lances, balls, swords,
axes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>maces, sparing me, fall on thy dear body, what
shall I do&mdash;I, good for naught without thee in this vile
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nele said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would fain follow thee; there will be no peril; I will hide
in the wooden forts where the arquebusiers are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou dost go, I stay, and they will hold thy friend
Ulenspiegel traitor and coward; but listen to my lay:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My hair is steel, as casque set there;</p>

<p class="first">And he went off singing, not without having kissed the
shaking mouth and the lovely eyes of Nele sunk in fever, smiling and
weeping all together.</p>
<p>The Beggars are at Antwerp; they take the ships of Alba even in the
very harbour. Entering the city, in broad day, they set free certain
prisoners, and make others prisoner to bring ransom. By force they make
the citizens rise, and some they constrain to follow them, on pain of
death, without uttering a word.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel said to Lamme: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The admiral&rsquo;s son is detained at the
<i>&Eacute;cout&ecirc;te&rsquo;s</i>: we must deliver him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going into the house of the <i>&Eacute;cout&ecirc;te</i>, they see
the son they sought in the company of a big monk with a noble belly,
who was preaching wrathfully to him, fain to make him return to the
bosom of our Mother Holy Church. But the lad would by no means consent
thereto. He departed with Ulenspiegel. Meanwhile Lamme, seizing the
monk by the cowl, made him walk before him in the streets of Antwerp,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art worth a hundred florins ransom: pack up and march
on. Why dost thou hang back? Hast thou lead in thy sandals? March, bag
of lard, victual press, soup belly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I march, Master Beggar, I march; but saving the respect due
to your arquebuse, you are as big in the belly as myself, a paunchy,
vasty fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lamme, pushing him on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou dare indeed, foul monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
liken thy cloistral, useless, lazy grease to my Fleming fat honourably
sustained and fed by toils, fatigues, and battles? Run, or I shall make
thee go like a dog, and that with the spur at the end of my
boot-sole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the monk could not run, and he was all out of breath, and Lamme
the same. And so they came to the ship.</p>

Beggars did not desire to have him dead, but paying ransom, began to
lift up his nose on board the ship:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; quoth he, marching and wagging his head
furiously, &ldquo;see in what a gulf of vile, black, and foul
abominations I have fallen in setting foot on this wooden tub. Were I
not here, I whom the Lord anointed....&rdquo;</p>

discourse, &ldquo;aye, mangy dogs, strays, defiled, starveling, that
have fled out of the rich pathway of our Mother the Holy Roman Church
to enter upon the parched highway of your tattered Reformed Church.

<p class="first">The duke of blood having quitted the country, Messires
de Medina-Coeli and De Requesens governed it with less cruelty. Then
the States General ruled them in the name of the king.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the folk of Zealand and of Holland, most lucky by reason
of the sea and their dykes, which are natural ramparts and fortresses
to them, opened free temples to the God of free men; and the murderous
Papists might sing their hymns beside them; and Monseigneur the Silent
of Orange refrained from founding a royal dynasty of stadtholders.</p>
<p>The Belgian country was ravaged by the Walloons who were
dissatisfied by the peace of Ghent, which, men said, was to quench all
hatreds. And these Walloons, <i>Pater-noster knechter</i>, wearing upon
their necks big black rosaries, of which there were found two thousand
at Spienne in Hainaut, stealing oxen and horses by twelve hundred, two
thousand at a time, choosing out the best, carrying off women and girls
by field and by marsh; eating and never paying, these Walloons used to
burn within their farmsteads the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307"
href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>armed peasants that tried to
prevent the fruit of their hard toil from being carried away.</p>
<p>And the common folk would say to one another: &ldquo;Don Juan is
soon to come with his Spaniards, and his Great Highness will come with
his Frenchmen, not Huguenots but Papists: and the Silent, desiring to
rule in peace over Holland, Zealand, Gueldre, Utrecht, Overyssel, cedes
in a secret treaty the lands of Belgium, for Monsieur d&rsquo;Anjou to
make himself a king therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the commonalty were still confident. &ldquo;The
States,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;have twenty thousand well-armed men,
with plenty of cannon and good cavalry. They will repel all foreign
soldiery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the thoughtful ones said: &ldquo;The States have twenty thousand
men on paper, but not in the field; they lack cavalry and let their
horses be stolen within a league of their camps by the <i lang=
"nl">Pater-noster knechten</i>. They have no artillery, for while
needing it at home, they decided to send one hundred cannon with powder
and shot to Don Sebastian of Portugal; and no man knoweth whither has
gone the two million crowns we have paid on four occasions by way of
taxes and contributions; the citizens of Ghent and Brussels are arming,
Ghent for the Reformation, and Brussels even as Ghent; at Brussels the
women play the tambourine while their men toil at the ramparts. And
Ghent the Bold is sending to Brussels the Gay powder and cannon, the
which she lacketh for her defence against the Malcontents and the
Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And man by man in the towns and the flat country, <i lang="nl">in
&rsquo;t plat landt</i>, sees that trust cannot be placed either in the
lords or in many another. &ldquo;And we citizens and common folk are
sore at heart for that giving our money <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>and ready to give our
blood, we see that nothing goes forward for the good of the country of
our sires. And the Belgian land is cowed and angered, having no trusty
chiefs to give it the chance of battle and to give it victory, through
great effort of arms all ready against the foes of liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the thoughtful folk said among themselves:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Peace of Ghent, the lords of Holland and of Belgium
swore the abolishment of hate, mutual help between the Belgian Estates
and the Estates of the Netherlands; declared the edicts null and void,
the confiscations cancelled, peace between the two religions; promised
to raze each and every column, trophy, inscription, and effigy set up
by the Duke of Alba to our dishonour. But in the hearts of the chiefs
the hatreds are still afoot; the nobles and the clergy foment division
between the States of the Union; they receive money to pay soldiers,
they keep it for their own gluttony; fifteen thousand law suits for the
recovery of confiscated property are suspended; the Lutherans and
Romans unite against the Calvinists; lawful heirs cannot succeed in
driving the despoilers from out their inheritance; the duke&rsquo;s
statue is on the ground, but the image of the Inquisition is enshrined
within their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the poor commonalty and the woeful burgesses waited ever for the
valiant and trusty chief that would lead them to battle for
freedom.</p>
<p>And they said among themselves: &ldquo;Where are the illustrious
signatories to the Compromise, all united, so they said, for the good
of the country? Why did these two-faced men make such a &lsquo;holy
alliance,&rsquo; if they were to break it at once? Why meet together
with so much commotion, rouse the king&rsquo;s wrath, to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>dissolve like cowards and traitors after? Five
hundred as they were, great lords and low lords banded like brothers,
they saved us from the fury of Spain; but they sacrificed the welfare
of the land of Belgium to their own profit, even as did d&rsquo;Egmont
and de Hoorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;see Don Juan come now,
handsome and ambitious, the enemy of Philip, but more the enemy of his
country. He is coming for the Pope and for himself. Nobles and clergy
are traitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they began a semblance of war. Upon the walls along the main
streets and the little streets of Ghent and Brussels, nay even upon the
masts of the Beggars&rsquo; ships, were then to be seen posted up the
names of traitors, army chiefs, and commanders of fortresses: the names
of the Count of Liederkerke, who did not defend his castle against Don
Juan; of the provost of Li&eacute;ge, who would have sold the city to
Don Juan; of Messieurs d&rsquo;Aerschot, de Mansfeldt, de Berlaymont,
de Rassenghien; the name, of the Council of State, of Georges de
Lalaing, governor of Frisia, that of the army leader the seigneur de
Rossignol, an emissary of Don Juan, the go-between for murder between
Philip and Jaureguy, the clumsy assassin of the Prince of Orange; the
name of the Archbishop of Cambrai, who would have given the Spaniards
entry into the town; the names of the Jesuits of Antwerp, offering
three casks of gold to the States&mdash;that was two million
florins&mdash;not to demolish the castle and to hold it for Don Juan;
of the Bishop of Li&eacute;ge; of Roman preachers defaming and abusing
the patriots; of the Bishop of Utrecht, whom the citizens sent
elsewhere to pasture on the grass of treachery; the orders of begging
friars, which intrigued and plotted at Ghent in favour of Don
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>Juan. The folk of Bois-le-Duc nailed on the
pillory the name of Peter the Carmelite, who helped by their bishop and
his clergy, undertook to hand over the town to Don Juan.</p>
<p>At Douai they did not indeed hang the rector of the university in
effigy, a man no less Spaniardized; but upon the ships of the Beggars
were seen on the breast of mannikins hanging by their necks the names
of monks, abbots, and prelates, of eighteen hundred rich women and
girls of the nunnery of Malines who with their money sustained, gilded,
and beplumed the country&rsquo;s butchers.</p>
<p>And on these mannikins, the pillories of traitors, were to be read
the names of the Marquis d&rsquo;Harrault, the commander of the
fortress of Philippeville, wasting and squandering munitions of war and
food uselessly in order to give up the place to the enemy under
pretence of a lack of provisions; the name of Belver, who surrendered
Lembourg, when the town might have held out another eight months; that
of the President of the Council of Flanders; of the magistrate of
Bruges, of the magistrate of Malines, holding their towns for Don Juan,
of the members of the Exchequer Council of Guelderland, closed by
reason of treachery; of those of the Council of Brabant, of the
Chancellery of the Duchy; of the Privy Council and the Council of
Finance; of the Grand Bailiff and the Burgomaster of Menin; and of the
ill neighbours of Artois, who gave passage without let to two thousand
Frenchmen bent upon pillage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the city folk among themselves, &ldquo;here
is the Duke of Anjou with a footing in our country: he would fain be
king among us; did ye behold him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311"

<p class="first">Seeing that he was allowed to say what he pleased, the
monk lifted up his nose on board the ship; and the sailors and
soldiers, to make him the more ready and eager to preach, slandered
Madame the Virgin, Messieurs the Saints, and the pious practices of the
Holy Roman Church.</p>
<p>Then, becoming enraged, he vomited out a flood of abuse against
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;aye, here am I then in the den
of the Beggars! Yea, these are indeed those accursed devourers of the
land! Yea. And they say that the Inquisitor, that holy man, has burned
too many of them! Nay: there is still some of the filthy vermin left.
Aye, on these goodly and gallant ships of our Lord the King, once so
clean and well scoured, now can be seen the vermin of the Beggars, aye,
the stinking vermin. Aye, they are vermin, foul, stinking, infamous
vermin, the singing captain, the cook with his belly filled with
impiety, and all of them with their blasphemous crescents. When the
king will have his ships scoured with the suds of artillery, it will
need more than a hundred thousand florins&rsquo; worth of powder and
cannon shot to clear away this filthy, beastly stinking infection. Aye,
ye were all born in Madame Lucifer&rsquo;s alcove, condemned to dwell
with Satanas between walls of vermin, under curtains of vermin, on
mattresses of vermin. Yea, and there it was that in their infamous
loves they begat and conceived the Beggars. Aye, and I spit upon
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this word the Beggars said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we keep here this idle rascal, who is good
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>for nothing but to spew up insults? Let us hang
him rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they set about doing it.</p>
<p>The monk, seeing the rope ready, the ladder propped against the
mast, and that they were about to bind his hands, said woefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity upon me, Messieurs the Beggars, it is the demon of
anger that speaks in my heart and not your humble captive, a poor monk
that hath but one only neck in this world: gracious lords, have mercy:
shut my mouth if ye will with a choke-pear; &rsquo;tis a bitter fruit,
but hang me not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they, without giving heed, and despite his furious struggles,
were dragging him towards the ladder. He cried then so shrill and loud
that Lamme said to Ulenspiegel, who was with him and tending him in the
cook&rsquo;s galley:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! my son! they have stolen a pig from the stable, and
they are making off. Oh, the robbers! if I could but rise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went up and saw nothing but the monk. And he, catching
sight of Ulenspiegel, fell upon his knees, with his hands outstretched
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messire Captain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;captain of the
valiant Beggars, redoubtable on land and on sea, your soldiers are fain
to hang me because I have transgressed with my tongue: &rsquo;tis an
unjust punishment, Messire Captain, for so must all advocates,
procurators, preachers, and women, be given a hempen collar, and the
world would be unpeopled; Messire, save me from the rope. I shall pray
for you; you will never be damned: grant me pardon. The devil of
prating carried me away and made me speak without ceasing: &rsquo;tis a
mighty misfortune. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>My poor bile soured then and made me say a
thousand things I never think. Grace, Messire Captain, and you,
Messieurs, intercede for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Lamme appeared on the deck in his shirt and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain and friends, &rsquo;twas not the pig but the monk
that was squealing; I am overjoyed. Ulenspiegel, my son, I have
conceived a high design with regard to His Paternity; give him his
life, but leave him not at liberty, else will he do some ill trick upon
the ship: rather have a cage built for him on the deck, a strait cage
well opened and airy, where he can do no more than sit down and sleep;
such a one as they make for capons; let me feed him, and let him be
hanged if he does not eat as much as I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be hanged if he will not eat,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel
and the Beggars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou mean to do with me, big man?&rdquo; said the
monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt see,&rdquo; replied Lamme.</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel did as Lamme wished, and the monk was put in a cage,
and all could contemplate him at their leisure.</p>
<p>Lamme had gone down into his galley; Ulenspiegel followed and heard
him disputing with Nele:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not lie down,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;no, I will
not lie down to have others groping and fumbling with my sauces; no, I
will not stay in my bed, like a calf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be angry, Lamme,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;or your
wound will reopen and you will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will die: I am tired of living
without my wife. Is it not enough for me to have lost her, without your
trying furthermore to prevent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>me, me the master cook of
this place, from myself keeping watch over the soup? Know ye not that
there is a health inherent in the steam of sauces and fricassees? They
even nourish my spirit and armour me against misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;thou must needs hearken to
our counsel and let thyself be healed by us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fain to let myself be healed,&rdquo; said Lamme:
&ldquo;but rather than another should enter here, some ignorant
good-for-naught, a frowsy, ulcerous, blear-eyed, dropping nosed fellow,
and come to king it as master cook in my place, and paddle with his
filthy fingers in my sauces, I would rather kill him with my wooden
ladle, which would be iron for that task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;thou must have
an assistant; thou art sick....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An assistant for me,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;for me, an
assistant! Art thou then stuffed with naught but ingratitude, as a
sausage is full of minced meat? An assistant, my son, and &rsquo;tis
thou that dost say so to me, thy friend, who have nourished thee so
long time and so succulently! Now will my wound reopen. False friend,
who then would dress thy food like me? What would ye do, ye two, if I
were not there to give thee, chief-captain, and thee, Nele, some dainty
stew or other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will work ourselves in the galley,&rdquo; said
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooking,&rdquo; said Lamme: &ldquo;thou art good to eat of
it, to smell it, to sniff it up, but to perform it, no: poor friend and
chief-captain, saving your respect, I could make thee eat leather
wallets cut up into ribbons, and thou wouldst take it for toughish
tripe: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>leave me, my son, to be still the master cook of
here, else I shall dry up, like a lathstick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain master cook then,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel; &ldquo;if
thou dost not heal, I will shut up the galley and we shall eat naught
save biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! my son,&rdquo; said Lamme, weeping for joy, &ldquo;thou
art good and kind as Notre Dame herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">And in any case he appeared to be healing.</p>
<p>Every Saturday the Beggars saw him measuring the monk&rsquo;s waist
girth with a long leather thong.</p>
<p>The first Saturday he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And measuring himself, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four feet and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he seemed melancholy.</p>
<p>But, speaking of the monk, on the eighth Saturday he was full of joy
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four feet and three quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the monk, angry, when he took his measure, would say to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me, big man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lamme would put out his tongue at him without a word.</p>
<p>And seven times a day, the sailors and soldiers saw him come with a
new dish, saying to the monk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be rich beans in Flemish butter: didst thou eat the like
in thy monastery? Thou hast a goodly phiz; there is no starving on this
ship. Dost thou not feel cushions of fat coming on thy back? Before
long thou wilt have no need of a mattress to lie on.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=

<p>At the monk&rsquo;s second meal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;there are <i lang=
"nl">koeke-bakken</i> after the Brussels fashion; the French folk call
them <i>cr&ecirc;pes</i>, for they wear crapes on their kerchiefs for a
sign of mourning: these are not black, but fair of hue and golden
browned in the oven: seest thou the butter streaming off them? So shall
it be with thy belly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no hunger,&rdquo; the monk would say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou must needs eat,&rdquo; was Lamme&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;Dost thou deem that these are pancakes of buckwheat? &rsquo;tis
pure wheat, my father, father in grease, fine flour of the wheat, my
father with the four chins: already I see the fifth one coming, and my
heart rejoices. Eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me in peace, big man,&rdquo; said the monk.</p>
<p>Lamme, becoming wrathful, would reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the lord and disposer of thy life: dost thou prefer the
rope to a good bowl of pea soup with sippets, such as I am about to
fetch thee presently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And coming with the bowl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pea soup,&rdquo; quoth Lamme, &ldquo;loves to be eaten in
company: and therefore I have just added thereto <i>knoedels</i> of
Germany, goodly dumplings of Corinth flour, cast all alive into boiling
water: they are heavy, but make plenteous fat. Eat all thou canst; the
more thou dost eat the greater my joy: do not feign disgust; breathe
not so hard as if thou hadst over much: eat. Is it not better to eat
than to be hanged? Let&rsquo;s see thy thigh! it thickens also; two
feet seven inches round about. Where is the ham that measureth as
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour after he came back to the monk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here are nine pigeons: they have
been slaughtered for thee, these innocent beasts that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>wont
to fly unfearing above the ships: disdain them not; I have put into
their bellies a ball of butter, breadcrumbs, grated nutmeg, cloves
pounded in a brass mortar shining like thy skin: Master Sun rejoices to
be able to admire himself in a face as bright as thine, by reason of
the grease, the good grease I have made for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the fifth meal he would fetch him a <i lang=
"nl">waterzoey</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thinkest thou,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;of this
hodgepodge of fish? The sea carries thee and feedeth thee: she could do
no more for the King&rsquo;s Majesty. Aye, aye, I can see the fifth
chin visibly a-coming a little more on the left side than on the right
side: we must fatten up this side that is neglected, for God saith to
us: &lsquo;Be just to each.&rsquo; Where would justice be, if not in an
equitable distributing of grease? I will bring thee for thy sixth
repast mussels, those oysters of the poor, such as they never served
thee in thy convent: ignorant folk boil them and eat them so; but that
is but the prologue to the fricassee; they must next be stripped of
their shells, and their gentle bodies put in a pan, then stewed
delicately with celery, nutmeg, and cloves, and bind the sauce with
beer and flour, and serve them with buttered toast. I have done them in
this fashion for thee. Why do children owe so great a gratitude to
their fathers and mothers? Because they have given them shelter and
love, but beyond all things, food: thou oughtest then to love me as thy
father and thy mother, and even as to them thou owest me the gratitude
of thy stomach: roll not against me then such savage eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently I shall bring thee a soup of beer and flour, well
sweetened with cinnamon a-plenty. Knowest <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>thou for why? That
thy fat may become translucent and shiver upon thy skin: such it is
seen when thou movest. Now here is the curfew ringing: sleep in peace,
taking no thought for the morrow, certain to find thy succulent repasts
once more, and thy friend Lamme to give them thee without
fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone and leave me to pray to God,&rdquo; said the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;pray with the cheerful music
of snoring: beer and sleep will make grease for thee, goodly grease.
For my part, I am glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme went off to put himself in bed.</p>
<p>And the sailors and soldiers would say to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, do you feed so richly this monk that wishes thee
no good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me alone,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I am accomplishing a
mighty work.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In May, when the peasant women of Flanders by night
throw backwards slowly over their heads three black beans to keep them
from sickness and death, Lamme&rsquo;s wound opened again: he had a
high fever and asked to be laid on the deck of the ship, over against
the monk&rsquo;s cage.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel was very willing; but for fear lest his friend might
fall into the sea in a fever fit, he had him strongly fastened down
upon his bed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>In his interludes of reason, Lamme incessantly enjoined on them not
to forget the monk: and he thrust out his tongue at him.</p>
<p>And the monk said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou dost insult me, big man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Lamme, &ldquo;I am fattening
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind blew soft, the sun shone warm; Lamme in his fever was
securely tied on his bed, so that in his witless spasms of leaping he
might not jump over the side of the ship; and deeming himself still in
his galley, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fire is bright to-day. Soon it will rain ortolans. Wife,
spread snares in our orchard. Thou art lovely thus, with thy sleeves
rolled up to the elbow. Thy arm is white, I would fain bite it, bite
with my lips that are teeth of live velvet. Whose is this lovely flesh,
whose those lovely breasts showing beneath thy white jacket of fine
linen? Mine, my sweet treasure. Who will make the fricassee of
cock&rsquo;s comb and chickens&rsquo; rumps? Not too much nutmeg, it
brings on fever. White sauce, thyme, and laurel: where are the yolks of
eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then making a sign for Ulenspiegel to bring his ear close to his
mouth, he said to him in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently it will rain venison; I shall keep thee four
ortolans more than the others. Thou art the captain; betray me
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then hearing the sea beat softly on the ship&rsquo;s side:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soup is boiling, my son; the soup is boiling, but how
slow is this fire to heat up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he recovered his wits, he said, speaking of the monk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? doth he grow in grease?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span></p>
<p>Seeing him then, he put out his tongue at him and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great work is being accomplished; I am
content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day he asked to have the great scales set up on the deck, and to
be set in it, he on one pan, the monk on the other: scarcely was the
monk in place than Lamme soared like an arrow in the air, and
rejoicing, he said, looking at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He weighs it down! he weighs it down! I am a weightless
spirit beside him: I will fly in the air like a bird. I have my idea:
take him away that I may come down; now put on the weights. Put him
back. What does he weigh? Three hundred and fourteen pounds. And I? Two
hundred and twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The night of the day after this, when the dawn was
rising gray, Ulenspiegel was awakened by Lamme crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel! Ulenspiegel! help, rescue, keep her from going
away. Cut the cords! cut the cords!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel came up on the deck and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou call out? I see naught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis she,&rdquo; replied Lamme, &ldquo;she, my wife,
there, in that skiff rounding that flyboat; aye, that flyboat whence
there came the sound of singing and the viol strings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele had come up on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the cords, my dear,&rdquo; said Lamme. &ldquo;Seest thou
not that my wound is cured, her soft hand hath healed it; she, aye,
she. Dost thou see her standing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326"
href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>up in the skiff? Dost thou
hear? she is singing still. Come, my beloved, come; flee not from thy
poor Lamme, who was so lonely in the world without thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele took his hand, touched his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hath the fever still,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the cords,&rdquo; said Lamme; &ldquo;give me a skiff! I
am alive, I am happy, I am healed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel cut the cords: Lamme, leaping from his bed in breeches
of white linen, without a doublet, set to work himself to lower away
the skiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him,&rdquo; said Nele to Ulenspiegel: &ldquo;his hands
tremble with impatience as they work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skiff ready, Ulenspiegel, Nele, and Lamme went down into it with
an oarsman, and set off towards the flyboat anchored far off in the
harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the goodly flyboat,&rdquo; said Lamme, helping the
oarsman.</p>
<p>On the fresh morning sky, coloured like crystal gilded by the rays
of the young sun, the flyboat showed up her hull and her elegant
masts.</p>
<p>While Lamme rowed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us now how didst find her again,&rdquo; asked
Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Lamme replied, speaking in jerks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sleeping, already much better. All at once a dull
noise. A piece of wood struck the ship. A skiff. A sailor hurries up at
the noise: &lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; A soft voice, her voice, my
son, her voice, her sweet voice: &lsquo;Friends.&rsquo; Then a deeper
voice: &lsquo;Long live the Beggar: the commander of the flyboat
<i>Johannah</i> to speak with Lamme Goedzak.&rsquo; The sailor drops
the ladder. The moon was shining. I see a man&rsquo;s shape coming up
on to the deck: strong hips, round knees, wide pelvis; I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>say
to myself: &lsquo;a pretended man&rsquo;: I feel as it might be a rose
opening and touching my cheek: her mouth, my son, and I hear her saying
to me, she&mdash;dost thou follow?&mdash;herself, covering me with
kisses and with tears: &rsquo;twas liquid perfumed fire falling on my
body: &lsquo;I know I am sinning; but I love thee, my husband! I have
sworn before God: I am breaking my oath, my man, my poor man! I have
come often without daring to come nigh thee; the sailor at last allowed
me: I dressed thy wound, thou knewest me not; but I have healed thee;
be not wroth, my man! I have followed thee, but I am afraid; he is upon
this ship, let me go; if he saw me he would curse me and I should burn
in the everlasting fire!&rsquo; She kissed me again, weeping and happy,
and went away in spite of me, despite my tears: thou hadst bound me
hand and foot, my son, but now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And saying this he bent mightily to his oars: &rsquo;twas like the
taut string of a bow that launches the arrow forthright.</p>
<p>As they approached the flyboat, Lamme said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is, upon the deck, playing the viol, my darling
wife with her hair of golden brown, with the brown eyes, the cheeks
still fresh and young, the bare round arms, the white hands. Leap
onward, skiff, over the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain of the flyboat, seeing the skiff coming up and Lamme
rowing like a demon, had a ladder dropped from the deck. When Lamme was
by it, he leapt from the skiff on to the ladder at the risk of tumbling
into the sea, thrusting the skiff three fathoms behind him and more;
and climbing like a cat up to the deck, ran to his wife, who swooning
with joy, kissed and embraced him, saying: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme! come not to take me: I have sworn to God, but I love
thee. Ah! dear husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Calleken Huybrechts, the pretty Calleken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but alas! the hour of
noon has gone by for my beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she seemed wretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hast thou done?&rdquo; said Lamme: &ldquo;what became of
thee? Why didst thou leave me? Why wilt thou leave me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and be not wroth; I will tell
thee: knowing that all monks are men of God I confided in one of them:
his name was Broer Cornelis Adriaensen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing which Lamme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that wicked hypocrite who had a
sewer mouth, full of filth and dirt, and spoke of naught but spilling
the blood of the Reformed; what! that praiser of the Inquisition and
the edicts! Ah, it was a blackguardly good-for-naught
rascal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calleken said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not insult the man of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of God!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I know him;
&rsquo;twas a man of filth and foulness. Wretched fate! my beautiful
Calleken fallen into the hands of this lascivious monk! Come not near
me, I will kill thee: and I that loved her so much! my poor deceived
heart that was all her own! What dost thou come hither for? Why didst
thou tend me? thou shouldst have left me to die. Begone, thou; I would
see thee no more, begone, or I fling thee in the sea. My
knife!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, embracing him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;my husband, weep not: I am
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>not what thou deemest: I have not belonged to
this monk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou liest,&rdquo; said Lamme, weeping and grinding his teeth
both at the same time. &ldquo;Ah! I was never jealous, and now I am.
Sad passion, anger, and love, the need to slay and embrace. Begone,
thou! no, stay! I was so good to her! Murder is master in me. My knife!
Oh! this burns, devours, gnaws; thou laughest at me....</p>
<p>She embraced him weeping, gentle and submissive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am a fool in my anger: aye,
thou didst guard my honour, that honour a man is mad enough to hang on
a woman&rsquo;s skirts. So it was for that thou wast wont to pick out
thy sweetest smiles to ask me leave to go to the sermon with thy
she-friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me speak,&rdquo; said the woman, embracing him.
&ldquo;May I die on the instant if I deceive thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die, then,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;for thou art going to
lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak or speak not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis all one
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broer Adriaensen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;passed for a good
preacher; I went to hear him: he set the ecclesiastic and celibate
estate above all others as being more proper to win paradise for the
faithful. His eloquence was great and fiery: several wives of good
repute, of whom I was one, and in especial a goodly number of widow
women and girls, had their minds troubled by it. The estate of celibacy
being so perfect, he enjoined upon us to dwell therein: we swore
thenceforward no longer to be spouses....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save to him, no doubt,&rdquo; said Lamme, weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent,&rdquo; said she, angry. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;finish: thou hast fetched me a
bitter blow; I shall never be whole of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;my man, when I shall be always
with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she would fain have embraced and kissed him, but he repulsed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The widows,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;swore between his hands
never to marry again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme listened to her, lost in his jealous musing.</p>
<p>Calleken, shamefaced, went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He desired,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to have no penitents save
young and beauteous wives or maids: the others he sent back to their
own cur&eacute;s. He established an order of devotees, making us all
swear to have no other confessors but himself only: I swore it; my
companions, more initiate than I, asked me if I was fain to be
instructed in the Holy Discipline and the Holy Penance: I wished it.
There was at Bruges, at the Stone Cutters&rsquo; Quay, by the convent
of the Franciscan friars, a house dwelt in by a woman called Calle de
Najage, who gave girls instruction and lodging, for a gold carolus by
the month: Broer Cornelis could enter her house without being seen to
leave his cloister. It was to this house I went, into a little chamber
where he was alone: there he ordered me to tell him all my natural and
carnal inclinations: at first I dared not; but in the end I gave way,
wept, and told him all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; wept Lamme, &ldquo;and this swine monk thus
received thy sweet confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He still told me, and this is true, my husband, that above
earthly modesty is a celestial modesty, through which we make unto God
the sacrifice of our earthly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href=
"#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>shames, and that thus we avow to
our confessors all our secret desires, and are then worthy to receive
the Holy Discipline and the Holy Penance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end he made me strip naked before him, to receive upon
my body, which had sinned, the too-light chastisement of my faults. One
day he made me unclothe myself; I fainted when I must let my body linen
fall: he revived me with salts and flasks.&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis well
for this time, daughter,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;come back in two
days&rsquo; time and bring a rod.&rsquo; That went on for long without
ever ... I swear it before God and all his saints ... my man ...
understand me ... look at me ... see if I lie: I remained pure and
faithful ... I loved thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor sweet body,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;O stain upon thy
marriage robe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamme,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;he spoke in the name of God
and of our Holy Mother Church; was I not to listen to him? I loved thee
always, but I had sworn to the Virgin, by dreadful oaths, to deny
myself to thee: yet I was weak, weak to thee. Dost thou recall the
hostelry of Bruges? I was at the house of Calle de Najage thou didst
pass by upon thine ass with Ulenspiegel. I followed thee; I had a
goodly sum of money; I spent nothing ever for myself. I saw thee an
hungered: my heart pulled towards thee, I had pity and love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; asked Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Calleken replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After an inquiry ordered by the magistrate and an
investigation of evil men, Broer Andriaensen must needs leave Bruges,
and took refuge in Antwerp. They told me on the flyboat that my man had
made him prisoner.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=
"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;this monk I am fattening
is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; answered Calleken, hiding her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hatchet! a hatchet!&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;let me kill
him, let me auction his fat, the lascivious he-goat! Quick, let us back
to the ship. The skiff! where is the skiff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a foul cruelty to kill or to wound a
prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou lookest on me with a cruel eye; wouldst thou prevent
me?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;I will do him no hurt:
let me only fetch him out from his cage. The skiff! where is the
skiff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed down into it speedily; Lamme made haste to row, weeping
the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art sad, husband?&rdquo; said Calleken to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am glad: doubtless thou wilt
never leave me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wast pure and faithful, thou sayest; but, sweet, my
darling, beloved Calleken, I lived but to find thee, and lo, now,
thanks to this monk, there will be poison in all our happiness, poison
of jealousy ... as soon as I am sad or but only tired, I shall see thee
naked, submitting thy lovely body to that infamous flagellation. The
spring time of our loves was mine, but the summer was for him; the
autumn will be gray, soon will come the winter to bury my faithful
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art weeping?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;what is past can never come
again.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Nele said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Calleken was faithful, she ought to leave thee alone for
thy ill words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knoweth not how I love him,&rdquo; said Calleken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou say true?&rdquo; cried Lamme; &ldquo;come, darling;
come, my wife; there is no longer gray autumn nor winter that diggeth
graves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he seemed cheerful, and they came to the ship.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel gave Lamme the keys of the cage, and he opened it; he
tried to pull the monk out on the deck by the ear, but he could not; he
tried to fetch him out sideways, he could not do that, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must break all; the capon is fattened,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The monk then came forth, rolling about big daunted eyes, holding
his paunch with both hands, and fell down on his seat because of a
great wave that passed beneath the ship.</p>
<p>And Lamme, speaking to the monk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou still say, &lsquo;big man&rsquo;? Thou art bigger
than I. Who made thee seven meals a day? I. Whence cometh it, bawler,
that now thou art quieter, milder towards the poor Beggars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And continuing further:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou dost stay another year encaged, thou wilt not be able
to come out again: thy cheeks quiver like pork jelly when thou dost
move: thou criest no longer already; soon thou wilt not be able to
breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold thy peace, big man,&rdquo; said the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big man,&rdquo; said Lamme, becoming furious; &ldquo;I am
Lamme Goedzak, thou art Broer Dikzak, Vetzak, Leugenzak, Slokkenzak,
Wulpszak, the friar big sack, grease sack, lying sack, cram sack, lust
sack: thou hast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334"
name="pb334">334</a>]</span>four fingers deep of fat under thy skin,
thy eyes can be seen no longer: Ulenspiegel and I would both lodge
comfortably within the cathedral of thy belly! Thou didst call me big
man; wilt thou have a mirror to study thy Bellyness? &rsquo;Tis I that
fed thee, thou monument of flesh and bone. I have sworn that thou
wouldst spit grease, sweat grease, and leave behind thee spots of
grease like a candle melting in the sun. They say that apoplexy cometh
with the seventh chin; thou hast five and a half by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to the Beggars:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this lecher! &rsquo;tis Broer Cornelis Adriaensen
Rascalsen, of Bruges: there he preached the new modesty. His grease is
his punishment; his grease is my work. Hear now, all ye sailors and
soldiers: I am about to leave you, to leave thee, thee, Ulenspiegel, to
leave thee, too, thee, little Nele, to go to Flushing where I have
property, to live there with my poor wife that I have found again. Of
yore ye took an oath to grant me all that I might ask of
you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the word of the Beggars,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Lamme, &ldquo;look on this lecher, this
Broer Adriaensen Rascalsen of Bruges; I swore to make him die of
fatness like a hog; construct a wider cage, force him to take twelve
meals a day instead of seven; give him a rich and sugared diet: he is
like an ox already; see that he be like an elephant, and ye will soon
see him fill the cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall fatten him,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; went on Lamme, speaking to the monk, &ldquo;I
bid thee also adieu, rascal, thee whom I cause to be fed monkishly
instead of having thee hanged: grow in grease and in apoplexy.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then taking his wife Calleken in his arms:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, growl or bellow, I take her from thee; thou shalt whip
her never more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the monk, falling in a fury and speaking to Calleken:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art going away then, carnal woman, to the bed of lust!
Aye, thou goest without pity for the poor martyr for the word of God,
that taught thee the holy, sweet, celestial discipline. Be accursed!
May no priest give thee absolution; may earth be burning underneath thy
feet; may sugar be salt to thee; may beef be as dead dog to thee; may
thy bread be ashes; may the sun be ice to thee, and the snow hell fire;
may thy child-bearing be accursed; may thy children be detestable; may
they have the bodies of apes, pigs&rsquo; heads greater than their
bellies; mayst thou suffer, weep, moan in this world and in the other,
in the hell that awaits thee, the hell of sulphur and bitumen kindled
for females such as thou art. Thou didst refuse my fatherly love: be
thrice accursed by the Blessed Trinity, seven times accursed by the
candlesticks of the Ark; may confession be to thee damnation; may the
Host to thee be mortal poison, and may every paving stone in the church
rise up to crush thee and say to thee: &lsquo;This woman is the
fornicator, this woman is accursed, this woman is
damned&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lamme, rejoicing, jumping for joy, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was faithful; he said it, the monk: hurrah for
Calleken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she, weeping and trembling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my man, remove this curse
from over me. I see hell! Remove the curse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the curse,&rdquo; said Lamme. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not, big man,&rdquo; rejoined the monk.</p>
<p>And the woman remained all pale and swooning, and on her knees with
hands folded she besought Broer Adriaensen.</p>
<p>And Lamme said to the monk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off thy curse, else thou shalt hang, and if the rope
breaks because of thy weight, thou shalt be hanged again and again
until death ensues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanged and hanged again,&rdquo; said the Beggars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the monk to Calleken, &ldquo;go, wanton, go
with this big man; go, I lift my curse from thee, but God and all the
saints will have their eyes upon thee; go with this big man,
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he held his peace, sweating and puffing.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lamme cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He puffs, he puffs! I see the sixth chin; at the seventh
&rsquo;tis apoplexy! And now,&rdquo; said he to the Beggars:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I commend you to God, thou Ulenspiegel; to God, you all my
good friends, to God, thou Nele; to God the holy inspirer of liberty: I
can do no more for her cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then having given all and taken from all the kiss of parting, he
said to his wife Calleken:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, it is the hour for lawful loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boat was slipping over the water, carrying off Lamme and
his beloved, he in the stern, soldiers, sailors, and cabin boys all
called out, waving their caps: &ldquo;Adieu, brother; adieu, Lamme;
adieu, brother, brother and friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nele said to Ulenspiegel, taking a tear from out the corner of
his eye with her dainty finger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art sad, my beloved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a good fellow,&rdquo; said he. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this war will never end; shall we
be forced to live forever in blood and in tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us seek out the Seven,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel: &ldquo;it
draws nigh, the hour of deliverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Lamme&rsquo;s behest, the Beggars fattened the monk in his
cage. When he was set at liberty, in consideration of ransom, he
weighed three hundred and seventeen pounds and five ounces, Flemish
weight.</p>
<p>And he died prior of his convent.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At this time the States General assembled at The Hague
to pass judgment upon Philip, King of Spain, Count of Flanders, of
Holland, etc., according to the charters and privileges consented to by
him.</p>
<p>And the clerk of the court spake as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to all men of common knowledge that a prince of any
land so ever is established by God as sovereign and chief of his
subjects that he may defend them and preserve them from all wrong,
oppression, and violence, even as a shepherd is ordained for the
defence and keeping of his sheep. It is in like manner known that
subjects are not created by God for the use of the prince, to be
obedient unto him in whatsoever he commandeth, be it seemly or
unseemly, just or unjust, nor to serve in the manner of slaves. But the
prince is a prince for his subjects, without which he could not be, to
govern them in accordance with right and reason, to maintain and love
them as a father doth his children, as a shepherd doth his sheep,
hazarding his life to defend them; if he doth not so, he must needs be
held for no prince but a tyrant. Philip the king hath launched upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>us, by calling up of soldiers, by bulls of
crusade and of excommunication, four armies of foreigners. What shall
be his punishment, by virtue of the laws and customs of the
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed,&rdquo; replied the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip hath played false to his oaths: he hath forgot the
services we rendered him, the victories we aided him to win. Seeing
that we were rich, he left us to be pillaged and put to ransom by the
Council of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed as ungrateful and a robber,&rdquo; replied
the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; the clerk went on, &ldquo;placed in the most
powerful cities of these countries new bishops, endowing and presenting
them with the goods of the greatest abbeys; and by the help of these
men he introduced the Spanish Inquisition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed as a murderer, the squanderer of
others&rsquo; wealth,&rdquo; replied the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nobles of these countries, seeing this tyranny, presented
in the year 1566 a request wherein they entreated the sovereign to
moderate the rigour of his edicts and in especial those which concerned
the Inquisition: he consistently refused this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed as a tiger abandoned and obstinate in his
cruelty,&rdquo; replied the States.</p>
<p>The clerk continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip is strongly suspected of having, through the
intermediary of his Council of Spain, secretly inspired the
image-breakings and the sacking of churches, in order to be able, under
the pretext of suppressing crime and disorder, to send foreign armies
to march against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed as an instrument of death,&rdquo; replied
the States. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;At Antwerp Philip caused the inhabitants to be massacred,
ruined the Flemish merchants and the foreign merchants. He and his
Council of Spain gave a certain Rhoda, a notorious scoundrel, the right
by secret instructions to declare himself the head of the pillagers, to
harvest the booty, to employ his name, the name of Philip the king, to
counterfeit his seals and counterseals, and to comport himself at his
governor and his lieutenant. The royal letters, which were intercepted
and are in our hands, prove this to be the fact. All took place with
his consent and after deliberation in the Council of Spain. Read his
letters; therein he praises the feat of Antwerp, acknowledges that he
hath received a signal service, promises to reward it, enjoins Rhoda
and the other Spaniards to continue to walk in this path of
glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed as a robber, pillager, and
murderer,&rdquo; replied the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask for nothing more than the maintenance of our
privileges, a sincere and assured peace, a moderate freedom, especially
with regard to religion which principally concerns God and man&rsquo;s
own conscience: we had nothing from Philip but deceitful treaties
serving to sow discord between the provinces, to subdue them one after
another and to treat them in the same way as the Indies, by pillage,
confiscation, executions, and the Inquisition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him be deposed as an assassin premeditating the murder of
a country,&rdquo; replied the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made the country bleed through the Duke of Alba and his
catchpolls, through Medina-Coeli, Requesens, the traitors of the
Councils of State and of the provinces; he enjoined a vigorous and
bloody severity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340"
name="pb340">340</a>]</span>upon Don Juan and Alexander Farn&egrave;se,
Prince of Parma (as may be seen by his intercepted letters); he set the
ban of the empire upon Monseigneur d&rsquo;Orange, paid the hire of
three assassins before paying a fourth; erected castles and fortresses
among us; had men burned alive, women and girls buried alive; inherited
their goods, strangled Montigny, de Berghes, and other lords, despite
his kingly word; killed his son Carlos; poisoned the Prince of Ascoly,
whom he made espouse Do&ntilde;a Eufrasia, with child by himself, in
order to enrich with his estates the bastard that was to come; launched
an edict against us that declared us all traitors, that had forfeited
our bodies and our wealth, and committed the crime unheard of in a
Christian land, of confounding innocent and guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By <span class="corr" id="xd20e9120" title=
"Source: alll aws">all laws</span>, rights, and privileges, let him be
deposed,&rdquo; replied the States.</p>
<p>And the king&rsquo;s seals were broken.</p>
<p>And the sun shown on land and sea, gilding the ripened ears,
mellowing the grape, casting pearls on every wave, the adornment of the
bride of the Netherlands, Liberty.</p>
<p>Then the Prince of Orange, being at Delft, was stricken down by a
fourth assassin, with three bullets in his breast. And he died,
following his motto: &ldquo;Calm amid the wild waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His enemies said of him that to thwart King Philip, and not hoping
to rule over the Southern Low Countries, which were Catholic, he had
offered them by a secret treaty to Monseigneur Monsieur Sa Grande
Altesse of Anjou. But Anjou was not born to beget the babe Belgium upon
Liberty, who loveth not perverse amours. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel left the fleet with Nele.</p>
<p>And the fatherland Belgium groaned beneath the yoke, fast bound by
traitors.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They were then in the month of the ripened grain; the
air was heavy, the wind was warm: the reapers, both men and women,
could gather in at their ease in the fields, under the free sky, upon a
free soil, the corn they had sown.</p>
<p>Frisia, Drenthe, Overyssel, Guelderland, North Brabant, North and
South Holland, Walcheren, North and South Beveland; Duiveland and
Schouwen that make up Zealand; all the shores of the North Sea from
Knokke to Helder; the islands of Texel, Vieland, Ameland,
Schiermonk-Oog, were, from the western Scheldt to the eastern Ems,
about to be freed from the Spanish yoke; Maurice, the son of the
Silent, was continuing the war.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel and Nele, having their youth, their strength, and their
beauty, for the love and the spirit of Flanders grow never old, were
living snugly in the tower of Neere, waiting till, after many hard
trials, they could come and breathe the air of freedom upon Belgium the
fatherland.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel had asked to be appointed commandant and warden of the
tower, saying that having an eagle&rsquo;s eyes and a hare&rsquo;s
ears, he could see if the Spaniard would not attempt to show himself
once more in the delivered countries, and that in that case he would
sound <i>wacharm</i>, which is the alarm in the speech of Flanders.</p>
<p>The magistrate did as Ulenspiegel wished: because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>of
his good service he was given a florin a day, two quarts of beer,
beans, cheese, biscuit, and three pounds of beef every week.</p>
<p>Thus Ulenspiegel and Nele lived very well by themselves two: seeing
from afar, with rejoicing, the free isles of Zealand: near at hand,
woods, castles, fortresses, and the armed ships of the Beggars guarding
the coasts.</p>
<p>At night they often climbed up on the tower, and there, sitting on
the platform, they talked of hard battles and goodly loves past and to
come. Thence they beheld the sea, which in this time of heat surged and
broke upon the shore in luminous waves, casting them upon the islands
like phantoms of fire. And Nele was affrighted to see the jack
o&rsquo;lanterns in the polders, for, said she, they are the souls of
the poor dead. And all these places had been battle-fields. The will
o&rsquo; the wisps swept out from the polders, ran along the dykes,
then came back into the polders as though they had no mind to abandon
the bodies whence they had issued.</p>
<p>One night Nele said to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how thick they are in Duiveland and how high they fly:
&rsquo;tis by the isle of birds I see the most. Wilt thou come thither,
Thyl? We shall take the balsam that discloseth things hid from the eyes
of mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel answered her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is the same balsam that wafted me to that great
sabbath, I trow in it no more than a hollow dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou must not,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;deny the potency of
charms. Come, Ulenspiegel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day he asked the magistrate that a clear-sighted and trusty
soldier should take his place, to guard the tower and keep watch over
the country.</p>
<p>And with Nele he went his way to the isle of birds.</p>
<p>Going across fields and dykes, they beheld little green lush islets,
between which ran the sea water; and upon the slopes of green sward
that came down to the very dunes an immense concourse of plovers, of
sea mews and sea swallows, that stayed motionless and made the islets
all white with their bodies; overhead circled and flew thousands of the
same. The ground was full of nests: Ulenspiegel, stooping to pick up an
egg upon the way, saw a sea mew come flitting to him, uttering a cry.
At his appeal there came more than a hundred others, crying with grief
and fear, hovering above Ulenspiegel and over the neighbour nests, but
they did not venture to come close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;these birds beg grace
for their eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then falling a-tremble, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afeared; there is the sun setting; the sky is white, the
stars awaken; &rsquo;tis the spirits&rsquo; hour. See these red
exhalations, gliding along the earth; Thyl, my beloved, what monster of
hell is thus opening his fiery mouth in the mist? See from the side of
Philip&rsquo;s land, where the butcher king twice for his cruel
ambition slaughtered so many poor men, see the dancing
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps: &rsquo;tis the night when the souls of poor
folk slain in battle quit the cold limbo of purgatory to come and be
warmed again in the soft air of the earth: &rsquo;tis the hour when
thou mayst ask aught of Christ, who is the God of good
magicians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ashes beat upon my heart,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>&ldquo;If Christ could show me these Seven whose
ashes cast to the wind were to make Flanders and the whole world
happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man of little faith,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;thou wilt see
them by virtue of the balsam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perchance,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, pointing to Sirius with a
finger, &ldquo;if some spirit descends from the cold star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his movement a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp flitting about him perched
on his finger, and the more he sought to be rid of it, the tighter it
clung.</p>
<p>Nele trying to set Ulenspiegel free, she, too, had her
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp on the tip of her hand.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel, striking at his, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer! art thou the spirit of a Beggar or of a Spaniard? If
thou be the soul of a Beggar, depart into paradise; if the soul of a
Spaniard, return into hell whence thou comest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nele said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not insult souls, were they even the souls of
butchers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And making the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp dance on her finger tip:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisp,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;dear wisp, what tidings dost
thou bring us from the country of souls? What are they employed in over
there? Do they eat and drink, since they have no mouths? for thou hast
none, darling wisp! or do they indeed take human shape only in the
blessed paradise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel, &ldquo;waste time in
this fashion conversing with this wretched flame that hath neither ears
to hear thee with nor mouth to answer thee withal?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>But without heeding him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisp,&rdquo; said Nele, &ldquo;reply by dancing, for I will
ask thee three times: once in the name of God, once in the name of
Madame the Virgin, and once in the name of the elemental spirits that
are messengers &rsquo;twixt God and man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did so, and the wisp danced three times.</p>
<p>Then Nele said to Ulenspiegel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off thy clothes; I shall do the same: here is the silver
box in which is the balsam of vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all one to me,&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>Then being unclad and anointed with the balsam of vision, they lay
down beside each other naked on the grass.</p>
<p>The sea mews were plaining; the thunder was growling dull in the
cloud where the lightning gleamed; the moon scarce displayed between
two clouds the golden horns of her crescent; the
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps on Ulenspiegel and Nele betook themselves off
to dance with the others in the meadow.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ulenspiegel and Nele were caught up in the mighty hand of a
giant who threw them into the air like children&rsquo;s balloons,
caught them again, rolled them one upon the other and kneaded them
between his hands, threw them into the water pools between the hills
and pulled them out again full of seaweed. Then carrying them thus
through space, he sang with a voice that woke all the sea mews
underneath with affright:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That vermin, crawling, biting,</p>
<p class="line">With squinting glances tries</p>
<p class="line">To read the sacred writing</p>
<p class="line">We hide from all men&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Read, flea, the secret rare;</p>
<p class="line">Read, louse, the sacred term</p>
<p class="line">That heaven, earth and air</p>
<p class="line">With seven nails hold firm.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">And in very deed, Ulenspiegel and Nele saw upon the
sward, in the air and in the sky, seven tablets of shining brass
fastened thereto by seven flaming nails.</p>
<p>Upon the tablets there was written:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Amid the dung May saps arise;</p>
<p class="line">If Seven&rsquo;s ill, yet Seven&rsquo;s well;</p>
<p class="line">The diamond came from coal, they tell;</p>
<p class="line">From foolish teachers, pupils wise&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">If Seven&rsquo;s ill, yet Seven&rsquo;s well.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And the giant walked on followed by all the
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, which said, chirping and singing like
grasshoppers:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Look well at him, &rsquo;tis their Grand
Master.</p>
<p class="line xd20e354">The Pope of popes and Lord of lords,</p>
<p class="line">Can change great C&aelig;sar to a pastor:</p>
<p class="line xd20e354">Look well at him, he&rsquo;s made of
boards.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Suddenly his features changed; he seemed thinner,
sadder, taller. In one hand he held a sceptre and a sword in the other.
And his name was Pride.</p>
<p>And casting Nele and Ulenspiegel down upon the ground he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then close by him, riding on a goat, there appeared a ruddy girl,
with bared bosom, her robe open, and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>lively sparkling eye:
her name was Lust; came then an old Jewess picking up the shells of sea
mews&rsquo; eggs: she had Avarice to name; and a greedy, gluttonous
monk, devouring chitterlings, stuffing sausages, and champing his jaws
continually like the sow upon which he was mounted: this was Gluttony;
next came Idleness dragging her legs, pallid and puffy, with dulled
eyes, and Anger driving her before her with strokes of a goad.
Idleness, woebegone, was bemoaning herself, and all in tears fell down
upon her knees; then came lean Envy, with a viper&rsquo;s head and
pike&rsquo;s teeth, biting Idleness because she was too much at her
ease, Anger because she was too vivacious, Gluttony because he was too
well stuffed, Lust because she was too red, Avarice for the eggshells,
Pride because he had a purple robe and a crown. And all around danced
the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps.</p>
<p>And speaking with the voices of men, of women, of girls and
plaintive children, they said, moaning and groaning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pride, father of ambition, Anger, spring of cruelty, ye slew
us on the battle-field, in prisons and with torments, to keep your
sceptres and your crowns! Envy, thou didst destroy in the bud many high
and useful ideas; we are the souls of persecuted inventors: Avarice,
thou didst coin into gold the blood of the poor common folk; we are the
souls of thy victims; Lust, thou mate and sister of murder, that didst
give birth to Nero, to Messalina, to Philip King of Spain, thou dost
buy virtue and pay for corruption; we are the souls of the dead:
Idleness and Gluttony, ye befoul the world, ye must be swept from out
of it; we are the souls of the dead.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>And a voice was heard saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Amid the dung May saps arise;</p>
<p class="line">If Seven&rsquo;s ill, yet Seven&rsquo;s well;</p>
<p class="line">For foolish teachers, pupils wise;</p>
<p class="line">To win the coal and ashes, too,</p>
<p class="line">What is the wandering louse to do?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire, &rsquo;tis we, vengeance for the bygone tears, the
woes of the people; vengeance for the lords that hunted human game upon
their lands; vengeance for the fruitless battles, the blood spilt in
prisons, men burned and women and girls buried alive; vengeance for the
fettered and bleeding past. The fire, &rsquo;tis we: we are the souls
of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the Seven were changed to wooden statues, while
keeping every point of their former shape.</p>
<p>And a voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel, burn the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ulenspiegel turning towards the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye that are fire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perform your
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps in a crowd surrounded the Seven,
which burned and were reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>And a river of blood ran down.</p>
<p>And from out the ashes rose up seven other shapes; the first
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pride was I named; I am called Noble Spirit.&rdquo; The
others spake in the same fashion, and Ulenspiegel and Nele saw from
Avarice come forth Economy; from Anger, Vivacity; from Gluttony,
Appetite; from Envy, Emulation; and from Idleness, the Reverie of poets
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>sages. And Lust upon her goat was transformed to
a beautiful woman whose name was Love.</p>
<p>And the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps danced about them in a happy
round.</p>
<p>Then Ulenspiegel and Nele heard a thousand voices of concealed men
and women, sonorous and laughing voices that sang with a sound as of
castanets:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When over land and sea shall reign</p>
<p class="line xd20e354">In form transfigured all these seven,</p>
<p class="line xd20e354">Men, boldly raise your heads to heaven;</p>
<p class="line">The Golden Age has come again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And Ulenspiegel said: &ldquo;The spirits mock
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a mighty hand seized Nele by the arm and hurled her into
space.</p>
<p>And the spirits chanted:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When the north</p>
<p class="line">Shall kiss the west,</p>
<p class="line">Ruin shall end:</p>
<p class="line">The girdle seek.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Ulenspiegel: &ldquo;north,
west, and girdle. Ye speak obscurely, ye Spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they sang, laughing:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;North, &rsquo;tis the Netherland:</p>
<p class="line">Belgium is the west;</p>
<p class="line">Girdle is alliance</p>

</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Ye are nowise fools, Messieurs the

<p class="first">Nele, as she fell, rubbed her eyes and saw naught save
the sun rising amid gilded mists, the tips of the blades of grass all
golden also and the sunrays yellowing the plumage of the sea mews that
slept, but soon awakened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href=
"#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Nele looked on herself, perceived that she was naked, and
clothed herself in haste; then she beheld Ulenspiegel naked also and
covered him over; thinking him asleep, she shook him, but he moved no
more than a man dead; she was taken with terror. &ldquo;Have I,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;have I slain my beloved with this balsam of
vision? I will die, too! Ah! Thyl, awaken! He is marble
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel did not awake. Two nights and a day passed by, and Nele,
fevered with anguish, watched by Ulenspiegel her beloved.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of the second day, and Nele heard the sound of
a bell, and saw approaching a peasant carrying a shovel: behind him,
wax taper in hand, walked a burgomaster and two aldermen, the
cur&eacute; of Stavenisse, and a beadle holding a sunshade over
him.</p>
<p>They were going, they said, to administer the holy sacrament of
extreme unction to the valiant Jacobsen who was a Beggar by constraint
and fear, but who, now the danger was past, returned into the bosom of
the Holy Roman Church to die.</p>
<p>Presently they found themselves face to face with Nele weeping, and
perceived the body of Ulenspiegel stretched out upon the turf, covered
with his clothes. Nele went upon her knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; said the burgomaster, &ldquo;what makest
thou by this dead man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not daring to lift her eyes she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray for my friend here fallen as though smitten by
lightning: I am all alone now and I am fain to die, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; then puffing with pleasure: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ulenspiegel the Beggar is dead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God be
praised! Peasant, make haste and dig a grave; strip off his clothes
before he be buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Nele, standing straight up, &ldquo;they are
not to be taken from him, he would be cold in the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig the grave,&rdquo; said the cur&eacute; to the peasant who
carried the shovel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; said Nele, all in tears; &ldquo;there are
no worms in sand that is full of chalk, and he will remain whole and
goodly, my beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all distraught, she bent over Ulenspiegel&rsquo;s body, and
kissed him with tears and sobbing.</p>
<p>The burgomaster, the aldermen, and the peasant were filled with
pity, but the cur&eacute; ceased not to repeat, rejoicing: &ldquo;The
great Beggar is dead, God be praised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the peasant digged the grave and placed Ulenspiegel therein and
covered him with sand.</p>
<p>And the cur&eacute; said the prayers for the dead above the grave:
all kneeled down around it; suddenly there was a great upheaving under
the soil and Ulenspiegel, sneezing and shaking the sand out of his
hair, seized the cur&eacute; by the throat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inquisitor!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou dost thrust me into
the earth alive in my sleep. Where is Nele? hast thou buried her, too?
Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cur&eacute; cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great Beggar returneth into this world. Lord God! receive
my soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he took to flight like a stag before the hounds.</p>
<p>Nele came to Ulenspiegel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me, my darling,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Then he looked round him again; the two peasants <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>had
fled like the cur&eacute;, and had flung down shovel and chair and
sunshade to run the better; the burgomaster and the aldermen, holding
their ears with fright, were whimpering on the turf.</p>
<p>Ulenspiegel went up to them, and shaking them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can any bury,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Ulenspiegel the spirit
and Nele the heart of Mother Flanders? She, too, may sleep, but not
die. No! Come, Nele.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went forth with her, singing his sixth song, but no man
knoweth where he sang the last one of all.</p>

<p>Till Eulenspiegel is a legendary medieval figure in Germany and the
Low Countries. Well known for his practical jokes and pranks that
circulate in stories and printed in chap-books since the 15th
century.</p>
<p>Charles the Coster transplanted this figure to the 16th century and
gave him a role in the war of independence of the Netherlands against
Spain. Although some of the pranks have survived, this is a completely
different story. By some this work is considered the Belgian national
epic. Curiously, even though it deals mainly with Flanders, this work
was originally written in French.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
